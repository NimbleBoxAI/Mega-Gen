These decisions will have to be about usage models rather than just a cost reduction, cost-optimisation or usage management. As such, we think that each cloud vendor will have the opportunity to understand how their customers use a particular service and to offer them solutions that help them make better use of the cloud as it grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "50. We intend to build personalised solutions for different organizations that can help to more easily manage services based on information or service configuration on demand. For example, if an organization's services are to be billed using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud with IAM service.\n",
      "\n",
      "51. We will look at the possibility and provide solutions for companies that have to manage multiple services on multiple platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "52. Cloud providers are not only providing the underlying data platform for storing applications and content/services, but are also adding new application technologies for cloud services such as Mobile Apps, Digital Services like Video and Image making it possible for the organizations to have a better managed cloud environment for their employees and clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "53. We will be looking to develop cost reduction strategies for the company using the data extracted using OCR.\n",
      "\n",
      "54. We want it to be automated once installed and also to be automated when maintenance of the solution is being done by the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "55. We intend to take advantage of advanced machine learning that can then identify patterns in resource usage, predict the future, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "56. We will be focusing on the use of cloud-based systems in a single organisation for more effective data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "57. we can use the information we get from services like Google, Google Docs, Google Drive, and others to optimize the billing for an organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "58. We will be building and offering \"on demand\" solutions for a range of services such as web services, email services, file services, document sharing services and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "59. We will be building systems that will monitor resource utilisation with real-time reports, to allow the companies to take corrective/optimisation actions accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "60. We will be developing a product for the customers to better use the cloud services they provide to their customers, by making them simpler and easier to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "61. We will be building solutions that can help build a cloud security culture by having a centralized data structure that helps the organisations to protect and audit their internal as well as cloud resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "62. This solution will use the best practices from the best practices framework (i.e., data/metadata and business/customer management best practices).\n",
      "\n",
      "63. We plan to provide our clients with a set of OCR services that are able to extract information from unstructured billing data and put it into business data systems with customised business rules built into them which can help organisations in understanding their bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "64. We will consider and research into the future of the cloud and how it can be utilised in the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "65. We will be built around the idea of using the power of Artificial Intelligence to allow machine learning and pattern recognition to be used for identifying optimal and optimal in resources, systems and their requirements across all the solutions that we build or rent for the customer. We will also build the ability for the company to access this information for any kind of use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "66. We will be developing a multi-platform solution that can be deployed in the cloud and on premise and that integrates with other companies and will be hosted on the Amazon Web server.\n",
      "\n",
      "67. We want to provide our customers with a single point of contact by creating an online portal. The system allows our customers to easily communicate with us and provide their billing information. We want people to be able to easily send emails with a single click instead of having to go through multiple systems which would then lead to multiple emails. Our aim is to make it as much pain free & simple as possible by creating seamless online portals for our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "68. We will be providing different solutions for organizations of different size and scale, using different services.\n",
      "\n",
      "69. Our company will deploy systems that help businesses achieve their cloud ambitions and make the cloud their own asset.\n",

      "\n",
      "72. We intend to build solutions using the data obtained from public sources as well as from the billing and other information from the organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "73. The aim - Build an application that helps businesses in reducing the costs of the cloud by optimising the cost of the cloud while at the same time offering the best services, features and support at the cost of the service provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "74. We will build personalised solutions with an emphasis on performance and cost, and will also need to be able to deploy them. This might not necessarily have to be automated as the data will be available from the cloud providers and data may need to be accessed and queried from both the APIs or the billing information.\n",
      "\n",
      "75. We will deploy the solutions based on the performance and cost of cloud services.\n",
      "\n",
      "76. OCR or Optical Character Recognition is the technology that takes a letter or letter like a word and breaks it into parts or morse or punctuation. OCR or Optical Character Recognition software is used to perform image recognition and OCR is also a type of machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "77. We will also develop applications that allow organizations to take an account balance from their cloud management console and use that data to find and then apply solutions to resource usage in the cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "78. We would ensure that our solutions are scalable to handle an increasing number of customers as the demand is there for these types of solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "79. If your organization does not have an internal solution, we are working on it, making sure it works well and is cost effective for the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "80. We already possess the skills in building OCR software, machine learning, data analysis, text pre-processing, building APIs and building systems from scratch, but we currently do not have the knowledge on developing the systems and deploying them on the cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "81. We can also do the same for existing applications to make them more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "82. We intend to combine different OCR libraries that give us a means to build better business solution for each client.\n",
      "\n",
      "83. Building a scalable server that runs applications in the cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "84. We will be providing a solution that not only helps businesses identify cost and resource savings on the services available in the cloud but also helps them build a better strategy of how best to scale up or down, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "85. This would involve taking a holistic approach in deploying and managing resources from the cloud providers. Some of the issues we would face would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "86. We will build a platform that makes it easy to create new virtual servers (cloud service). We will provide a powerful UI where end users, administrators and operations groups can create and deploy new physical servers, as per their current needs and preferences. Our team will build custom tools for creating, updating and viewing the server information in this UI. We would build a user management module to integrate and manage cloud, email and other related systems for users, and would take care of all the necessary and important administration tools\n",
      "\n",
      "87. We will take advantage of the cloud as much as possible and not be very strict with our resource needs to ensure that we get a good return on our investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "88. To avoid a lot of overhead, we will automate the whole process of building up our billing model and automating data gathering so the process of billing cloud services is a lot less painful for our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "89. The aim would be to develop tools that can integrate different billing and OCR services to build a common platform that can work with different cloud services. Such as, for example, SAP with SAP S/4\n",
      "\n",
      "90. The platform will make use of technologies like RDS, LDAP and OIT such as the OCR technologies to extract the required information from the bills before they reach the systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "91. Using the data obtained from the billing and other information from the organizations build a better solution for managing services. For example, there would have to be a model for making sure that different systems are using the resources efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "92. We will need the support of Data scientists from academia and industry to help with the research about cloud services and the new technologies that will help us to build the systems\n",
      "\n",
      "93. As we will be building systems for different organizations and different cloud infrasturcture, we prefer to do things in a way, which makes least difference to the customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "94. We believe that cloud cost optimisation is not limited to hardware alone. We believe that using the cloud means companies get to access better data and faster than ever. In this way we can make some smart algorithms that can help organisations understand the costs and performance of using cloud computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "95. We want to build a business grade, business intelligence and reporting system. This will be built to extract data from the cloud provider to identify business specific performance metrics, compare against a benchmark and provide a recommendation for the organization. This will also allow the organization to benchmark and benchmark against other organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "96. We will be using AI components of products like Microsoft Forefront (Sage 500) to analyse the data and extract relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "97. We will be building an open source tool to enable end to end automation solutions for cloud cost reduction and optimisation. This tool would be utilising the data extracted from public sources and the internal systems to deliver automated solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "98. We will aim to get the best of both worlds for the customers. Using the information obtained from customers we can build a bespoke solution that can provide a cost optimised solution. We can also provide solutions using external service providers as well as build a bespoke solution using public information.\n",
      "\n",
      "99. We will also work on some interesting business model to create or co-create business plans for our companies through a platform called PEN or POA services that will help us in planning and controlling our use of the resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "100. Most probably, we will build SaaS as an option for most users. So we will be able to provide cloud services for clients and they can be accessed using their own domain name. Our customers can buy the cloud modules, pay the bills and they can use the cloud modules even after they move back to personal domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "101. We will have the ability to design and implement very specific solutions that can handle some of the most complex problems faced by technology startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "102. We intend to build intelligent systems and software solutions to better manage the various resources which are required to run the organization including cloud computing systems.\n",

      "103. We will provide custom solutions for our clients with tools for analysis on all the billing data obtained from all the cloud providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "104. We will be building applications that could help the Cloud Service Provider(s) and end users make more optimized usage of their service with better billing.\n",
      "\n",
      "105. We will have data collection systems that can do the same from the public sector databases like government portals and also help improve government performance. The data that can be used by such an organisation could contain personal customer's information that could be used for better management of the public data infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "106. We will be building systems that help organizations with the use, tracking, and management of resources consumed on a per user and per resource basis. This is called \"resource-aware\" systems and it is critical and missing in many cloud solutions that exist today.\n",
      "\n",
      "107. We will be building systems that manage the services that we have and use OCR to ensure that we are not wasting our resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "108. We will integrate AI to improve the performance and decrease the costs of the systems while providing a cost savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "109. We are also planning to use big data and machine learning to optimize a lot of resources and make them more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "110. We will implement a web and mobile application that could help to create revenue for the organization by finding the most cost effective and least expensive cloud management.\n",
      "\n",
      "111. This is a great opportunity for the startup community as I have seen similar companies are using this idea\n",
      "\n",
      "112. We will be building solutions where we can manage multiple AWS accounts from a single dashboard and provide multi-region support.\n",
      "\n",
      "113. We plan to incorporate the OCR technologies into smart phone applications that can pull the information from OCR from the billing, which we can then use to build a better, personalised and automated processes to manage the resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "114. We intend to build solutions that can provide access to enterprise applications through a personalised and targeted access control model.\n",
      "\n",
      "115. Use information such as: company name, city, type of business, cost, revenue, expenses from public sources to build a model that optimizes our internal resources and costs when compared to any cloud solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "116. We intend to provide solutions for a wide range of industries including retail, healthcare, manufacturing, education, defence, real estate, government, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "117. We are planning to use both internal and external services to achieve the above.\n",
      "\n",
      "118. The whole solution would be in a SaaS model, with the pricing charged from the cloud provider. The cloud provider can charge different prices for different use cases and for different organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "119. We will build business rules to extract information and find business intelligence, and would also work with other data sources such as payment and tax, which may also contribute to find answers to questions like \"Do we need to pay taxes?\" without having to directly ask each person.\n",
      "\n",
      "120. We need to build systems which can work and run without knowing if the cloud provider is up or down, whether there are any problems or if the service is working.\n",
      "\n",
      "121. We will be building systems that have the ability to manage multi domain/sub-domains including support for private data as well, where customers require different levels of services or billing policies for different sub accounts on different domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "122. We also intend to build tools to reduce the cloud costs that will make companies to lower their costs and to cut down on expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "123. We will be building software that help us deal with the billing and subscription management in the cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "124. This will take more time and money due to the custom coding involved but in the end it will benefit the organization and its users tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "125. We will be extending our current offering to help in managing the costs of the cloud. The solutions and technology we build would be scalable to support a large number of organizations that has very little resources to manage. We aim to make all the different cloud services manageable to the point where they can become a business part of our company.\n",
      "\n",
      "126. We intend to build tools that are both useful and scalable for both internal and external consumption of billing and personalised services that we build\n",
      "\n",
      "127. Some of this will take place using the existing platforms of my company to provide the information to build these solutions (such as, billing management and account information to process data)\n",
      "\n",
      "128. Our cloud solutions will be provided on the basis of a SaaS model that can use both on premise or cloud solutions for infrastructure. This would save both companies and the individual users the extra cost of maintaining the infrastructure that they had been paying for.\n",
      "\n",
      "129. We will be building and releasing the web app that would allow end users to manage and consume cloud services in a simple and intuitive manner.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "143. We will be building solutions that scale infinitely and can make sure if the systems are not there then they would find a suitable replacement, without the user needing to worry about it. We will be offering a lot of automation within the Cloud Management Platform that will make a great user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "144. We will be working with the partners in an on-going basis. For a cloud based solution it's important to have the vendors involved in the solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "145. We try to do this using data science and build the model and solution as the organization grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "146. I will like to share this on my LinkedIn profile as a great example of how cloud computing is used and how we see it evolving:\n",

      "\n",
      "178. we aim to provide complete and accurate cost based analysis for cloud providers. We have used CloudCost.com for the same but in our case we need to provide an API and have an internal application that can provide real time cost based analysis of services and usage, which in turn can help in reducing the cost of services and managing the resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "179. We will design and implement solutions that support the various needs the cloud providers may have.\n",

This would be built from scratch using open technology with a cloud of its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "183. A good way to keep your budget in check would be to use a cloud provider and the API to extract necessary information and send it to you, but a bad way would be to build everything yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "184. We already have a product in place for the on-premise billing and CRM which can interact with cloud services, this will be the foundation of the solution.\n",

      "924. We will need to build a set of tools/services that allow organizations to efficiently deploy servers/virtual machines that have no limit on the number of servers we can provision as long as the cost is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "925. We will be building solutions that run on a local platform and provide different applications for different needs. For instance, we will be able to provide the same application for a mobile enterprise use case, but it will provide better data security.\n",
      "\n",
      "926. It would be built in a way that IT professionals would be able to configure and tweak to get the best out of the cloud services in the most cost-effective way.\n",
      "\n",
      "927. We will be building systems that enable companies, governments, and other entities to provide their customers with cost optimized services.

      "\n",
      "960. We will provide both the development and integration platform as well the solution for the cloud management as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "961. For example, if a client has a billing problem due to over or under billing or due to data mismatch, this solution will be built using the data obtained from the organizations as well as that received from the public sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "962. We intend to build systems that can use data from public or corporate sources to generate recommendations for allocating resources to the customer.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "965. We will be building systems with the ability to make predictions and suggest optimal solutions based on the data. For example, by predicting that a system will take too long to run and recommend adding more capacity without the cost of additional capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "966. We are trying to come up with a unique solutions based on the needs of our target market.\n",
      "\n",
      "967. The company would use tools to help determine how this can be leveraged in the most efficient way for the organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "968. We will make an ecosystem based around the data. Thus the ecosystem takes on the use and the benefits of all the other platforms so the data can be used and consumed at the optimal level of efficiency and cost minimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "969. Our goal will be to simplify the billing process for cloud providers by providing to the companies their most current pricing information including discounts and usage information such as the number of users per hour, the number of documents per hour, the number of virtual machines and what else they use the cloud for.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "976. We intend to build systems that help data governance. This will involve identifying the various aspects of cloud computing related to it, such as security, and building systems that can help with that. This will also involve using systems to ensure that the data within the cloud gets to where it is going. It this system is properly built, this will help cloud users in managing their own data securely and easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "977. We are building something that would empower organizations by providing them with information on their spend that they can use to build budgets, make strategic decisions on future investment of time and money.\n",

      "\n",
      "979. We intend to develop software and automated processes that can help enterprises with automation in their cloud infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "980. To do this we will need big data technologies like Apache Hadoop, MongoDB, Apache Spark, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "981. We will also be working towards providing tools to manage and optimise the billing based on the resource consumption rather than looking into the billing on an on-demand basis.\n",

      "\n",
      "985. We will build a system that uses an integration with Amazon Web Services and can support both private as well as some public AWS services.\n",
      "\n",
      "986. For example, the cloud billing system we will create would have different modules to help identify cloud usage, billing systems, costs etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "987. We will be building some of our applications in Java (applets and servlets) and some of that will be cross platform (client/server) as well as client/server only (J2EE). However, the majority of the applications will still be on client/server only, as Java has a low development cost but it's not the ultimate solution for any of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "988. We need a way to extract billing information from the billing APIs and then provide an optimal OCR solution so that other cloud services can get paid and manage the cost effectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "991. Cloud can be a good option for the small organizations who get new clients each month from the companies, and they don't want to invest in a new data centre that can only handle a few users.\n",
      "\n",
      "992. The data provided from these solutions will enable us to optimize the cost of running the system for each org.\n",
      "\n",
      "993. We are going to start by building custom solutions to the following areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "994. We intend to work on enabling organizations that have a lot of internal data like ERP systems and legacy accounting system to use our system. We will take advantage of this with our new model where we will work closely with the organizations to provide them with a complete and accurate audit to their cloud service consumption over the last 4 to 5 years,\n",
      "\n",
      "995. We are building our own cloud products, which can be provided free of cost or paid by the end user.\n",
      "\n",
      "996. In addition to use public APIs it would be useful to also create public APIs that are not publicly available - something we could call APIs for customers only so to avoid misuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "997. A hybrid platform will be built that will perform the operations that requires heavy compute and low memory, while providing other services to the organizations (such as providing access to corporate data to certain departments or users). This would provide much needed scalability for the organizations without the need to scale the whole system.\n",
      "\n",
      "998. We would build a lot of modules for different functional areas in order to give clients better solutions by providing a platform that not only simplifies the services and billing related to the cloud but it will provide analytics.\n",

      "1. Home Service. This option is slightly more profitable than cleaning services. The only difference in this business is that a worker is hired for the day. The only drawback is that one may have to wait for deliveries, which is not as feasible if done all the time. One could set a regular schedule, but the number of people taking over will depend on the amount of work that the business does.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Custom T-shirt printing. This option costs almost nothing from beginning and is almost always a good business idea. Even if one is unable to make the money, they can at least sell their shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. A beauty salon. For as little as $500 to $2000, one can easily setup a salon at home. These would be somewhat profitable, but not super. It is best to set up in one's garage or room and use a business license.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Dry Cleaning. This is a very profitable business if the clients are aware of the high quality work required. It would take a few hundred of extra money though. An average yearly income for a dry cleaner is $3000 depending on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Con-crete Company. One may get the required equipment and start up for as low as $8000. These businesses could be profitable on their own, or with a little more work, one could eventually have a profitable business of their own. This option is also moderately profitable, but demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Custom Paint shop. This business could be quite profitable in the middle of the year. From $4000 - $8000, in this business, one can have a nice salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Personal Care and Service. If you can make it a lucrative business in the summer season, it will also be a profitable summer months work. As low as $500 and take up to $2000 for first equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Bikes Rental Shop. In this case, the start up cost is $1000 plus $2000 for a license. This would make up the remaining $1000 to be loan for the startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Food Truck. With high profit margins at an estimated $1000/month, one could establish it with little effort and have all the necessary equipment, but is not lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Cleaning service. This is a very low-profit category, and again, can be started with the equipment for as low as $1200.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Pizza delivery and catering. This option is generally cheaper due to no rental cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Barbershops. There are quite a few barbershops, both in the country and overseas, where one could get started for about $300 to $400. Once the store is open, more profits can be earned and more work can be generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Pet Sitting Business. If a few people need a little extra help, then one can start a pet sitting agency to hire pet sitters. One needs to select the pet-sitting agency he wants to use. Then he can use PetCareAdvisor.com to find and hire pet sitters to ensure that one hires a reliable and trustworthy agency. This is pretty low cost option.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Concrete Cutting and Grinding business. This is one of the safest options on the list because it requires little down payment. The only downside is that one cannot advertise one's business.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Auto Parts Depot. The prices of all automobile part businesses may fluctuate wildly, but the margins are fairly steady. Therefore we could start an auto parts business that has low profits in terms of profits per dollar and still be profitable. This business will need a truck to transport items, and some overhead like advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Bar. This is not as profitable as many other business ideas, but a bar as a single operation could also be offered to the general public through a bar owner and could be easily marketed.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Auto shop. This business could be an average of $1200 but this should not be taken lightly after learning of the down sides. You have to keep the vehicle running for 8-10 hours a day and this also would create heavy expenses. Another option to this is to set up an apartment, this is also very profitable for $2000. The rent and maintenance would lower this to $1000.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Beauty salon. One could purchase a beauty parlor for as little as $3000. In most case, starting a business and renting space is less of a problem, which saves money.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Pet Sitting Business. One could rent out pet sitting space for as low as $2000, or set up a small business in a dog run or have a small dog to sit at home, which is also profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. Golf Course. One may even invest in a golf course for as low as $7000, including all the equipment and the golf courses‘ upkeep for about $1500. These would be moderately profitable businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Home Maintenance for Rent. One could rent your home out and charge as little as $500 per week while still being relatively profitable. When one rents out their home, they must pay utility bills, insurance, real estate taxes and maintenance cost of one’s home. When someone owns it, they only have to pay a monthly rental fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. Beauty Shop. It does not really require much of a physical space to set up shop. You can set up this business for as low as $1000. The main things that should be bought to set up this business is a basic beauty tool kit and a few makeup sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. Dental Care. A cheap cleaning business can clean teeth, and give massages from $300-$1500 that are profitable. This job needs a store room and maybe even some equipment. It is highly profitable, but it would require a capital investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. Convenience Store. One with a business license can sell beer, soft drinks, snacks, chips, and more. These are low income but are usually available almost anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Bakery.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. Restaurant. We would recommend that a business owner to first set up a business plan. A restaurant business would be easy to start a restaurant. If it is located in a busy metropolitan area, a little more cash would be necessary to open the business. There are a lot of businesses that have more or less high profit margins, which are affordable for most lenders in order to get into the business. Of course, the low profit margins of restaurants make it a profitable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "27. Hair and Make-Up Salon. For as low as $2500, one can set up a very profitable salon.\n",
      "\n",
      "28. Bakery. One could set up one bakery for as low as $2000. The high profit margin is from the high turnover in the bakery, especially during the summer seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "29. Carpet and T.V. installation business. One could get a carpet cleaning and installation truck for as low as $12000 and get a truck with all the necessary parts included for about $18000, excluding rent, to get a fully established business. This idea is profitable for a longer time period. However, demand can be reduced in areas when gas prices are high and thus these businesses are not quite profitable on a short term basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "30. Real Estate. One could get a location as low as $30000 up to $50,000 and just purchase properties, pay rent and pay some property taxes. This option is very profitable, and a lot faster than going through a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "31. Photography Studios. This is a low risk way of creating income. The only overhead is you will have to spend $20 daily to take pictures. However, for a family with small children your costs will be minimized. If a small family business of 10 or less persons is chosen, the overhead would be less.\n",
      "\n",
      "32. Beauty salons. In this business one need not purchase a shop and start it off. It is sufficient to have hair cut and spa treatments. This would be a very profitable business option and the same as the previous.\n",
      "\n",
      "33. Beauty Salon. This option costs less than $3000 and if properly set up would be very profitable. Many beauty salons in India have no overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "34. Web design Company. These are actually the most profitable of the businesses. You could charge about $1500 for a business plan, $1200 for a domain name, and $50 for a web site. This would take you about 10 months to get the business up and running, and the income would be between $1000 and $2000 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "35. Small Retail businesses. There are plenty of small business that do require only a storefront, so for as low as $6000, one could open up a retail store. Most of these businesses are moderately profitable, but if demand is low, then it has a relatively high probability of being profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "36. Video Poker Business. One can start this business for as low as $3000. It would be one of the cheapest options available.\n",
      "\n",
      "37. Cleaning Supplies. This business does not necessarily need a store. The supplies to this business can be quite flexible depending on the nature of the use. For as low as $2700, one can purchase the essential equipment and become a highly profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "38. Car Wash. The first one is probably closest for all the reasons, but there are many more options for a car wash business with the car wash industry is very competitive. For as low as $3000 per week, one can start this business. This is a reasonable profit on a low price.\n",
      "\n",
      "39. Personal care services. This business becomes highly profitable when it becomes available during all seasons. This business does not necessarily need a store, which saves money. For as low as $1500, you can get all the required equipment and start your business. This is moderately profitable, but demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "40. Internet start-up. An individual with an internet connection and a laptop can start an Internet start-up business at a low cost. The start-up would be a fairly low profit margin business.\n",
      "\n",
      "41. Jewelry Business. This business does not need a huge space for a store. For as low as $3000, one can open a jewelry shop with only one large store to take care of. This is not a very profitable business, but a high yield business.\n",
      "\n",
      "42. Pet Sitting. This is a profitable business, especially if set up as a seasonal service. The only problem with this business is time. It will slow down the summer months because people will want the service during those months.\n",
      "\n",
      "43. Restaurant. One could purchase a restaurant for as low as $8000, and in some cases it would be better to lease it for a lower monthly payment. For as low as $12000, one could get all the required equipment and put them up for rent. The more valuable the location, the more profit you could expect. There are not too many profitable options, but this one can be the least profitable but the shortest and hardest to lose money if you do not plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "44. Construction business. One could start this business for as low as $2000 to get the business going. This option is not an affordable option because of the equipment, but it is not hard to make an income with this option.\n",
      "\n",
      "45. Online business. Now this is a very feasible option as well. One would need to have access to high speed internet services to become financially successful. This can be a $40k business and it is also a very profitable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "46. Dining Out. One can open a small restaurant with a restaurant-kitchen for as low as $2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "47. Food and beverage store. Start with something that can produce small quantities of fresh food that cost $0 and can sell them for a profit, $3000 for example, and expand on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "48. Auto body repair. For as low as $3000, one can start up a body repair shop. This is quite profitable, though demand depends on location, which would probably have to be on a larger scale to make the cost realistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "49. Video Productions. One could start a very profitable video production business at around $3000 as low as $3000 if one could find a good neighborhood in which to set up shop. This business would only need to be a short term business and requires little capital to get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "50. Cleaner/Dry cleaner. One could start this as a full time business with a large staff of employees for as low as $500/day. One can increase this to $5000+ with an increase in employees. This is a viable option if there is ample demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "51. A clothing store. One can choose to set up their own apparel store or outsource it to a company that can help it run. For as low as $50,000, one can put up the store and get it up and running. The only downside is that there may be no sales due to bad economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "52. Bar. This industry may be moderately profitable, but depends greatly on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "53. Gas Station. One could buy a gas station business for only $1000 for a low profit margin of around $100. If this were not available, one could use an existing grocery store that is already in service. These are very profitable for low-income persons and need not cost very much money at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "54. House Cleaning and Meal Prep Services. This business can make a decent living while being very profitable if the customer base becomes large enough and the customers do not mind doing some additional work.\n",
      "\n",
      "55. Lawn care services. This is a very profitable option, but has a higher demand as it is so easily available. If one locates their business on an appropriate plot, they could get as high as $8000.\n",
      "\n",
      "56. Personal Services. One could open a personal services business with as much as $10,000 to get started. It is profitable because of the variety of services that one could provide from cleaning and maintenance to decorating a home, as well as providing a pet groomer service.\n",
      "\n",
      "57. Confectionary. This seems like a great business idea, as with the ice cream truck, one could have their own business for a little bit cheaper. This small business does not have high profit margins, but when customers buy lots, it is very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "58. Web Designing Service. This business may not be profitable until one starts running a website for the first time, but they get a pretty good start.\n",
      "\n",

      "121. A Restaurant. One could start a restaurant in the summer months, and save as much as $2500 just before winter arrives, as these high seasons are when the restaurants are at their highest revenue, and most profitable of the year.

      "165. Air Conditioning repair shops. Any business can call a repair shop to get service and equipment needs taken care of. For as low as $2000, one could get their business running very profitably. The more you have the more profits you can make.\n",
      "\n",
      "166. Diner/fast food. If one can make a reasonable amount, such as $200/hr at an existing diner, and has reasonable start up costs, an $8-10,000 loan is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "167. Jewelry design and wholesale. This business would need a store, but with a low-profit margin. It could be starting with a wholesale price of $3000.\n",
      "\n",
      "168. Restaurant. One could set up a restaurant for as low as $5000 which does not involve much start up costs. Although some restaurants are too big to be able to be profitable, other restaurants are fairly profitable and can turn a high profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "169. Painting and Drywall. While painting and dry wall is a high profit option, a low profit start up would not be as viable.\n",
      "\n",
      "170. Barbershop. One could open a barbershop for as low as $5000, in order to open up a little niche market of people who want to get a haircut.\n",
      "\n",
      "171. Jewelry Shop. Some women may have great jewelry collection which they want to sell for extra money. One does not need much space to maintain a jewelry shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "172. Cleaning and Care businesses can get started for as low as $1100.\n",
      "\n",
      "173. Laundry. Laundry is very hard to do. Most laundries do not make much profit, but still need to charge a reasonable price to their customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "174. Painting Shop. The same low start up cost as woodworking businesses, can be achieved in this business. For as low as $4000, they would be quite profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "175. Restaurant. One could open a restaurant for as low as $2500. This would be an excellent opportunity for someone that has started a food truck or small store that requires equipment (e.g. mop, forklift, kitchen). This is the most profitable option, but still costs more than $2500.\n",
      "\n",
      "176. Web Browsers. One could try creating an online business with an estimated budget of only $13000, depending on traffic and advertising costs only. This business runs well profitably throughout the world, and needs little set up cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "177. Hair Salon. Harsh weather condition and summer, low sales of hair services could make this option unattractive. Hair salons could be very profitable in a warmer climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "178. Cleaning and Care services. This is almost the same option, except the equipment is slightly different. For $1000, one can get all the needed equipment for a cleaning and care services business. A little more expensive, but still affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "179. Computer Repair Services. This option is still profitable. The only problem is that this business must get a computer, a scanner, and an internet connection. This may cost $500, maybe more.\n",
      "\n",
      "180. Web page design business. This is a very profitable business if it is properly handled. One can easily make a profit through this option, even if it is considered an entry level company. One can invest this amount and set up the website as a very well organized one. In return, one would enjoy a stable source of income until things start getting difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "181. Barber Shop. The profit margins of barbers make it quite reasonable to offer a loan, even at an interest rate of 10 to 15 percent. If you have high-end equipment, you can sell for $13,000 to $20,000 per year, leaving a profit for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "182. Restaurant/Bakery. The profit margin on the restaurant is rather high, but it can make it difficult to get a loan. With a simple kitchen, a business of the same line as a cafe or a restaurant is not too difficult to open up. All one needs is to buy the equipment needed for the kitchen and the necessary stock for the meal. This takes up a little more cash and requires a simple bank loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "183. Photography Equipment Supply. As low as $2000 one can start a business from this option.\n",
      "\n",
      "184. Photography Studio and studio. For around $10000, it would be feasible to open an area for photography. An ideal idea would be starting at $1000 and growing by $2000. With this type of business, it is very feasible to get a good amount of profit from the business while at the same time not costing a lot of money. However, the cost to run this type of business would depend on various factors such as equipment, location, and other business expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "185. Food truck. For as low as $8000, one can get a food truck, which can also be used another place for another work. This is a profitable option, especially if the profits are not huge. It also helps if the business is in an area that is a tourist destination, such as Times Square in New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "186. Car Service. One could purchase a car service or a car detailing service, with a small monthly payment. This business requires a large initial investment, and is quite unlikely to be profitable. However, one could make enough money to get it paid off with a small loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "187. Home-based day care business. One could get a licensed and bonded day care school up and running for as low as $4000, for as low as $7000-10,000, depending on location. The daycare students need a place to live, but this business is highly profitable, with low start up costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "188. Business Directory. One could set up a business directory for as low as $6000 (include all the required components including rent), which is more profitable than other options, but is still considered a low risk business.\n",
      "\n",
      "189. Restaurant. If one were to set up a restaurant for as low as $300 and $1000, one would only need a little initial start up cost and one could get good profit margins over time. A $300 to $800 investment will easily be able to pay back the initial investment plus a decent profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "190. Bakery. Bakery does not require a store, so it is the cheapest option for start-up. For as low as $1000, one can set up a basic shop and start their business. By keeping the shop small and having only one person behind it to handle sales, you get the least profit from this as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "191. Grocery store and Dairy Store. Grocery and Dairy Stores are a profitable business option, but you would only have 1 man. Therefore, $3000 plus 1 man cannot be that much for one man to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "192. Business Cards. One could get high-quality business cards for as low as $200.00. If your needs are modest, use this plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "193. A restaurant. This business does not need a lot of money and can generate a decent profit with a low-cost restaurant. It is highly ideal when one can only have a business during peak seasons, which are summer or fall, instead of opening for the whole day, which is only feasible when one is in a bigger city like Toronto or Vancouver. This business can range from $5000 to $16000 depending on location, but there is a cost to open the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "194. Lawn Care Services. One could buy and manage a lawn care business for as low as $4000 to as high as $20,000, depending on the number of workers one needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "195. Electricians. One can begin with as low as $4000 to get all the equipment required and then work on raising profits by raising prices on their services.

      "\n",
      "196. Internet Radio Station. One can set up a radio service for as little as $6000.\n",
      "\n",
      "197. Electrician/HVAC Service. One could set up a service shop to repair various electrical devices, as well as electric and gas heating units that do not include a gas station. This company would be moderately profitable, although it would also have expenses to be taken care of.\n",
      "\n",
      "198. Restaurant. One could have a restaurant from about the $20000 to the $6500 range. This option is moderately profitable, but location affects profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "199. Video rental. With the advent of digital download, one could purchase a video streaming server, digital cinema equipment, and all other required equipment and start a business for as low as $8000. This option is highly profitable and this business will give you a steady flow of income.\n",
      "\n",
      "200. Housecleaning. This is somewhat profitable, depending on the location. As low as $1000, one can obtain the necessary equipment and start their business. As the demand and number of workers grows, the business would eventually become profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "201. Home Based Business. This is very profitable business that a lot of people prefer because there are no heavy competition. The cost to start up would be about $1000.\n",
      "\n",
      "202. Pet Food and Water Treatments. These businesses do not necessarily require a store, but could be set up so a store would not be required. Their success is the fact that they do not require a store to begin with, and they do not necessarily need to serve more than one client. Their success is that people love food and water.\n",
      "\n",
      "203. Video Games. This business could make a very successful product, but would require a high number of people. For as low as $3000, one can start one video game store.

      "\n",
      "204. Auto Repair. One could set up an auto repair shop for $5000, in case of emergency, and this is a high profit option. One could save about $4000 on the shop and keep the profits off of the auto repair shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "205. Barber Shop. One can start a local barber shop for as low as $1500; which may not be a bad option, considering that the barbers will spend a lot of time there.\n",
      "\n",
      "206. Hair Design Service. One can hire a Hair Designer for $3000 to start the business. These services are not as profitable as others, but are not the most risky business option.\n",
      "\n",
      "207. Photography studios. One could open a large photography studio for as low as $2000 to $3000.\n",
      "\n",
      "208. Pizza. One could purchase a large pizzeria and set up in a shopping center. Costs may run around $12000 to setup, which is still an excellent option.\n",
      "\n",
      "209. Real Estate Sales. This can be an attractive option, as it requires very little capital. One can sell one's home or apartment for as low as $3000. With the low cost of real estate, it can be an afforable option to take out a loan to start up your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "210. Baking & Pastry Shop. This is another relatively profitable option, and one could start up an office on this. However, it may not be very profitable unless they have a following base. For as low as $1000, one could open up a small bakery with a small menu and still get a reasonable amount of profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "211. Bakery. One can rent space in a bakery for as low as $3000 for a few months. During this time, they would not need to pay rent and use their inventory, allowing another option to save cost of space.\n",
      "\n",
      "212. Personal Injury Lawyer. This is a high profit business, as fees only depend on the nature of case, a lot of trial attorney fees should be covered by the customer. With a high profit margin, as the case does not always take a lot of time or money, a business should be able to pay higher loan interest rates. Some personal injury lawyers charge as high as $125000 for a case involving the death of one’s spouse or small children.\n",
      "\n",
      "213. Restaurant. This type of business can be set up as a take out for $3000, or as a full service business. As much as a 60% loss would bring down your profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "214. Housecleaning Service. This business can be quite profitable as it requires quite a few employees to work. This option would require a start up of $2500 and above and an average annual turnover of $1000 to earn the $1000 profit required.\n",
      "\n",
      "215. Restaurant. One could open a small restaurant and get out of the kitchen and just be in charge of preparing food. This is probably the easiest way to go about starting a business. From this simple beginning, one could increase the menu and increase the profit margins. You will not have to worry about equipment or high cost insurance. Although, it is best to hire help or be a franchisee for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "216. Video Game Rental Service. While this is only about $3000, it starts small enough to be an option, and does not have to have a retail store on location to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "217. Restaurant. A restaurant can be set up for as low as $2000 to start up, taking all the necessary equipment and getting started. This business can be quite profitable, taking into consideration the low start up costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "218. Pet Shops. Some pet shops have low profit margins, but their demand is high. To be able to open a successful pet shop requires a very large profit margin. The low start up costs of this option are not ideal, but it can still be a successful business.\n",
      "\n",
      "219. Hair Salon. It can be as profitable as you can get. In order for this business to pay for its own operation, it needs to receive high volume customers and generate a steady revenue stream. This business requires at least $20,000 to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "220. Hair Salon. One can start up this business at lower costs and get them running at a low start up cost, which makes them profitable. These businesses do produce some profit, but they are not a huge profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "221. Auto Insurance. This type of business could take up the most space for a low budget of $30000 up to $15000\n",
      "\n",
      "222. Office Space. This business does not have to have a store. Office Space provides an affordable business option without the expenses of purchasing a store. This option could work for a small business or just something nice to store personal belongings in.\n",
      "\n",
      "223. House Painting. This is one of the most lucrative business that can be set up with a low start up cost. All that one needs for this type of business is a few gallons of paint and the knowledge and expertise to use them on site.\n",
      "\n",
      "224. House Cleaning. House Cleaning is a bit of an expensive way to go, but if one is determined they can open the shop for as low as $3000, which would allow the owner to make enough money to pay back a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "225. Auto Repair Shop. Most auto mechanics do very well in summer months, because the demand is very high, but during cold winters, the demand is low. By setting up a small business, one can still get their business during low demand seasons, which makes the cost of running the business a little more affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "226. Dry Cleaning. This business is quite profitable during the summer months because people who would not wash their clothes can wash it at home and pay for the dry cleaning cost in their free time. The winter months would not be as profitable because most washing and drying is done at a dry cleaners in the winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "227. Pet Shoppe. There are a lot of options here for as low as $3000. One can advertise online or at local pet stores and let the customers come and see the pets. While this business is not very profitable, it still creates a lot of business and thus needs a business loan with good credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "228. Dry Cleaning services. There are a wide range of service and cleaning businesses like dry cleaning, laundry, dog grooming. These could be combined into one location for about $8100. These would also be profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "229. Confectioneries. There are several options available, and many are quite expensive. One can choose between owning a shop, selling wholesale in a store, selling by appointment only, selling in supermarkets (very high margins, but expensive), or renting. If a shop is used, there are many other services to take care of such as mowing lawns and snow removal, and so on. A shop will take more space, but more people, such as the one above, will come. There\n",
      "\n",
      "230. Jewelry making services. One could get started with $1000 to get the necessities for starting one up. This is not too successful with demand also dependent on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "231. Electrician. One can set up an electric company for a low as $2000 and still make a decent amount of money. Their pay is also quite good, so the profit from the service is higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "232. Car Sales. A classic business idea that would save money would be to sell used cars that would not need the sales tax that would be lost at a local market. For example, one could sell the cars at a car lot for $300/per car, without the extra $6. This business will be highly profitable, but will need a hefty loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "233. Real Estate Investment. This business, being a business, would probably not demand that much from a loan. An investment of only $5000 would produce a profit of around 65%.\n",
      "\n",
      "234. Hair Salon. This could be a very profitable business, as the cost to own is very low for the right location. One could pay only 1/5\n",
      "\n",
      "235. Carwash. One could just use the car to wash the cars and get a profit on that. This is just as profitable as car services, and possibly higher than regular car wash services.\n",
      "\n",
      "236. Office Furniture. One could hire office help and save on rent. This will save around $5000 per year, which is reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "237. Airplane Service. This option costs $11,000 to $12,000 but it is pretty profitable for all that it costs during peak season.\n",
      "\n",
      "238. Laundry business\n",
      "\n",
      "239. Internet Service. This service business is one of the most profitable types of business. It’s simply the reason most businesses are set up. In addition to being quite profitable, having one as small as $6000 or $24000 can be feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "240. Business Services\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "242. Concrete. This is the most profitable option for those looking for a low interest option. One can build a building to house this kind of business, and save up and start up the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "243. Dental Practices. Dental offices could be an option of starting up for as low as $3000. This is not a viable option, though, because dental offices have high overhead costs and are hard to run profitably.\n",
      "\n",
      "244. Airplane rentals. One could rent an airplane for as low as $2000 and get set up for business. Most aircraft have annual maintenance fees that are quite high for a small owner, making the plane slightly more profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "245. Computer Store. This is one of the profitable options that would be ideal if the cost to rent the store is low. One could rent the business space for as low as $600 and start up without putting too much work in setting it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "246. Business Magazine. A low cost business idea is to write an occasional magazine covering something like a specific topic. For as low as $2000, one can start a business magazine with no overhead and a potential $24,000 annual profit with a large following.\n",
      "\n",
      "247. Dog House. For as low as $2500, one could open a private dog house for one pet (and for as low as $1000 without the fee, one can also add an extra pet with no extra charge). This is reasonably profitable as well as a good option.\n",
      "\n",
      "248. Restaurant. Start out with an idea of owning a restaurant. A good business plan will make it look appealing. A restaurant would be ideal for a low income family.\n",
      "\n",
      "249. Car Wash. This business does not necessarily need a store, which makes a loan possible. For as much as $2000, one could get needed equipment and set up shop. This business is very profitable at the beginning, but will decrease and eventually end in failure. However for a small fee one may end up in debt for a very long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "250. Bookstore. Again, this business could be started with a low budget, but the start up of the bookstore would be much more lucrative. For as low as $1500, one can come up with a full-time worker, pay rent, and start a legitimate business. This is extremely profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "251. Internet Shoppes. One could set up an internet store for as low as $5000. This is a relatively profitable option. The low start-up costs ensure that the initial investment will go for huge amounts.\n",

      "252. Music Studio. One could get a studio for as low as $5000 to start and this business would be decent to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "253. Restaurant services. Again, this option does not require a store, and can easily be set up in-store. This is a decent business option because it does not cost too much to start up. It is not very profitable, but if one is good at what they do, there will be much demand for this type of a service.\n",
      "\n",
      "254. Video Studio. One could hire out a video studio at $1000 per day. This business is fairly profitable, it is possible to get one going that does not depend on location or profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "255. Carpet cleaning service. This business does not necessarily need a store, which saves money. For as low as $500, one can afford to start up their own carpet cleaning service. Unlike carpet cleaning stores, the carpet cleaning business would need to have an established business and to be licensed and insured.\n",
      "\n",
      "256. A Video rental shop. For as little as $3000, one could open up a video rental store. In areas with a high number of people and a medium-high to high rent, the rental business is moderately successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "257. Pet Shop. There are many companies that offer pet boarding services and even pet grooming services. As low as $4000, one could do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "258. Ice Cream Parlor. While this business is considered to be unprofitable, one could have an ice cream parlor for as low as $3000 or can lease one for as low as $6000. This option is not too profitable, but the low start up costs make it a lucrative option.\n",
      "\n",
      "259. Web Designing. The start up costs are a little high, but the high profit margins make this business financially feasible for an individual seeking to get started at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "260. Personal training. This option also does not necessarily need a store. For start-up costs of $3000, one needs to have minimum 5 clients to have a viable business, as one does not want too many clients on the first account. This type of business usually requires a location that has a good clientele and is easily accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "261. Jewelry Store. For as little as $5000, one could get up and running. This business can be extremely profitable if the demand is high and the profits are high.\n",

      "262. Dry Cleaning and Laundry services. This is a business that does not require a store, but still saves money and is slightly profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "263. Web Designing. One could set up a company with no capital requirements, and just work on their projects online or do it as a home business for a fee. As a home business, it only takes 30 min to $500 a day to work on it. The only downside is how much time it would take to create a website. That depends on how fast you work and how much time it would take to create. And how much money do you have to spend. So it would take about\n",
      "\n",
      "264. Photography Studio. The cost of getting a photographer is very high, but the actual cost of running the business is relatively low.

      "\n",
      "265. Car Wash & Tire Shop. This business needs to use extra space for their services. One can rent this extra space for $2000 to $3000, depending on number of customers they receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "266. Painting and Carpentry. The idea is to purchase a cheap, small carpenter's setup to start out and then build upon that when the business gains a larger client base. The rental model is great for a first shop, but as the market grows, the business can expand with increasing costs.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "268. Laundry Services. This business is fairly lucrative, but needs a store to operate. One could save money by purchasing a shop that has two washing machines, for as low as $3000. The cost should add up more with an additional set of machines, which can be as little as $3000. One could also acquire a commercial-grade dryer for as little as $3000. Additionally, if purchasing an additional washing machine that has an apron on it, as well as a small desk\n",
      "\n",
      "269. Hairdressing. This is a somewhat low paying industry, yet it has the advantage of not having a brick or mortar store. However, there is a limited market for hair styling, which keeps the costs down; a little more for location. This way, one may afford to charge $600-$1200 for an average of 1-2 haircuts a month, or as per the price, a customer might be able to walk a few customers a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "270. Golf Club. This business would only take about $6000 if it were located out in the country, but could charge anywhere from $2000 to $8000 for a course and 18 hole green fees.\n",

      "271. Restaurant. It would be costly for an operator to purchase the land, make a building for the restaurant, and open for the first time in the New Year. Nonetheless, these are three times in a year when most people would be out to eat. These establishments would also depend on how often they are open to gain a customer base.\n",

      "272. Office Furniture. This option is relatively profitable, but with demand, can start at around $35,000 - $40,000. With the low start up costs, it could definitely be feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "273. Car Repair shop. One could purchase a very profitable car repair business for as low as $6000. Again, profit depends on location and competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "274. A pet food store. One can purchase one of these for a small investment, and start this business at around $300 to $500 per week. This is a slightly profitable business that makes little effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "275. Tires and Tire Repair. This is a very profitable option that can be expanded from a single location to 5 locations at a cost of $5000 to $7000 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "276. Small Baking Company. One could purchase ingredients and bake their own bread and cookies for as low as $2000. This is also a moderate profit option, although demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "277. A Pet Shop. For as low as $500, and most businesses are open around the holidays, this business is profitable in the cold months. Most of the time, animals have low demand and could go to their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "278. Music store. If one can afford it, they can build a small music shop (not requiring an expensive store) for only $12000 and get it running at the end of the year. This would cost $1200, but could yield a profitable business. To get the most profit, the store should be located in an area with more musicians and more customers. These businesses are great on a small budget and not feasible on more expensive loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "279. Car Wash. This would cost a lot, but it could be profitable in a good location and an increase in market is very likely. In fact, most of these businesses, especially in the car wash industry, are not profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "280. Painting and Decorating. As low as $3000, you could set up an honest to goodness painting and decorating business for high profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "281. Dry Cleaning services. One could do dry cleaning for people for an as low as $1000 to $1700. This would not be very profitable however.\n",
      "\n",
      "282. Video Game Rentals, Online Casinos, Etc. This is another option, which does not necessarily need a store.\n",
      "\n",
      "283. Office Cleaning and Maintenance. This option is similar to cleaning services. One could hire a cleaning service company to do the work, with the work starting up at only $5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "284. Home Depot Sales. A good number start their service with just a home depot truck. For as low as $2000, one can purchase all the required equipment, but then one purchases materials for their own stores with the assistance of a local store or another individual willing to finance the project. These are not highly profitable, but can afford to get their business started on a $2000 loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "285. Car Wash. In this business, one could start off with a budget of $6000 for the initial investment, which would get a car wash going. In a year, one can expect a profit, depending on the location, and the number of cars serviced.\n",
      "\n",
      "286. Funeral Home. This is a very profitable business, not just because of the revenue it brings in with people paying for funeral plans to hold open funerals. The low cost structure also means a very nice profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "287. Music Lessons. One could do a course of music lessons for $3000, which is moderately profitable, and get a good number of students.\n",
      "\n",
      "288. Pet supplies. You can just set up your small-scale pet shop for as low as $3000, which is only moderately profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "289. Real Estate. The best option for this business is to get a store and turn into an auction house. Although this option is very profitable in certain places in the country, other areas may not have this demand. Still, this option would be viable in all locations throughout the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "290. Car Wash. Weighing a couple of thousand, is a relatively low profit option. However, not many people can afford an ice cream truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "291. Restaurant. The average cost of starting a restaurant with one person is about $5000 to start up. One could also lease a restaurant for as low as $300 per month. This choice would usually not be any money and would not cost much to start up if the need arose.\n",
      "\n",
      "292. Bicycles. This has a higher profit margin, but is also more dangerous with bicycle crashes. They do not allow children under age 12 or pregnant women, which limits the amount of time that one can operate these two businesses. With this business, you could operate as low as $18000 for a full bike shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "293. Hair Stylists & Beauticians. This is a very lucrative option with high profit margins. For $5\n",
      "\n",
      "294. Auto Wrecker. One could buy car wreckers and start working for them as a general handyman. This too is not all that profitable. The car wrecker business would have to cater to a certain market.\n",
      "\n",
      "295. Business to Business services. A cleaning service could have a good profit with no investment, as long as it operates at an optimal level.\n",
      "\n",
      "296. Hair care businesses. These businesses require a huge investment in the hardware as well as in the rent and maintenance. These businesses should not be undertaken lightly without proper market analysis. One can invest to improve their business to get profits. However, as mentioned in the first few paragraphs, these businesses are profitable during summer seasons only.\n",
      "\n",
      "297. Bakery, Cafe, or Deli. One can rent a bakery, cafe or deli for as low as $1000-$5000 per month, for running a business which needs to be profitable. It has to be profitable to get a loan from a bank, and if successful will make a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "298. Dry Cleaning. This business can be set up and operated on a low or modest amount of investment but needs an effective marketing plan to have a long term viable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "299. Painting. One can get some cheap painting done for as low cost as $3000. Paint can be very profitable. This is because there are many uses for the paint, the paint is not too expensive, and if one decides to sell, the profit will be minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "300. Painting. Paint stores would have a very high profit margin, but the cost of rent should not make it imposible. The cost of paint should be between $5000 and $15000.\n",
      "\n",
      "301. Pizza Hut. Investing only $7000 will allow one to set up a pizza hut with a high profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "302. Personal Care and Medical Business. This would be a nice niche to start out on and should produce much higher profits than the other three.\n",
      "\n",
      "303. Barbers. The barber business is similar to other barbers, except the clients are a different type of people who would not have an interest in spending money on a haircut for them. In these days, one could get a small barber shop for around $3000 and get it up and running in few days' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "304. Hair Boutique. One could take the hair stylist business and start this business at a low and manageable $30000. They would be able to turn their profit into a loan to cover their start up costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "305. Photography Studio. Depending on available space in a residential area, this business can operate with as little as $1000. The low start up costs also make this option moderately profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "306. Bakery. Some bakeries could open to as low as $8000 to open a bakery and the profit margins would be quite good. If they are located in a high-proval area, the profit margins would be higher. With a lower start up costs, it could be more profitable with the need of a store.\n",
      "\n",
      "307. Internet Internet Service. Internet business also works well, especially for one that does not use computers. One can set up a business to provide web site development. All you need is a computer, a modem, a computer programming language, and your software. Web site development is very profitable, as this is one of the areas the Internet is most used for. A web site can grow into an empire because there is always more demand for such. The market can also be expanded through advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "308. Pizza Restaurant. There are a great many restaurants out there that would be more profitable if they would be able to hire people to make their pizza and serve it too. If only $3000 to $5000 would be sufficient, this option can certainly do well.\n",
      "\n",
      "309. Dry cleaners. It could get pricey if you hire a full time worker. For $2000, an owner could setup it on their own. The cost of the supplies would be the total of $4000.\n",
      "\n",
      "310. Jewelry services. This type of business could cost quite a bit to start, but would be highly profitable if it is able to maintain it's current level of services over a period of time. The costs to pay these people is quite large, so a loan would not be feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "311. Pet grooming and day care business. Starting at around $2500 and going to $5000, one can establish a successful pet grooming and day care business. The small start-up costs make pet grooming and day care quite profitable, and the equipment such as a washing machine and an oven is not too expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "312. Computer Repairing shop. One can also set up a repair shop for as little as $3000 to start up, which is very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "313. Auto Repair and Maintenance. This business makes slightly more than the $1000, but if you live in Los Angeles or Miami, then this is an excellent option.\n",
      "\n",
      "314. Pet Clinic. It could cost as low as $5000 to get the necessary equipment. This would be a profitable business, but it requires a location. If a location is not possible, then this option is a bit less promising without a store.\n",
      "\n",
      "315. Jewelry and Antiques. This is another profitable business; though the profits do not seem to reflect the expense. This business requires a special and unique product that is not found in any other store to make money. For example, the prices of diamond jewelry can increase several hundred dollars per item, so the overhead also requires a great deal of work, but the returns are high.\n",
      "\n",
      "316. A small hardware store. This could be as low as $2700 per year, which could be spent for rent and equipment. This is fairly profitable, but costs a little bit more.\n",
      "\n",
      "317. Cleaning and Care services: Another business option is cleaning and care services, that can be started for as low as $3500. As the market demand increases, one could easily open up shop and make decent profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "318. Barber Shop. One could start up a barber shop for $3000 to start, but may never be profitable. The start up will depend on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "319. Barbershops. They cost a lot, especially in larger cities. This one should get more profit because a lot of money is already invested by the city or town. Of course the profit would be small, but the high price of a salon business makes this business a great low-cost, but high-profit, option.\n",
      "\n",
      "320. Online sales of apparel and other items. There are many people who are unable to attend trade shows. Through online sales, one can sell almost anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "321. Gasoline Station. I know this business is not profitable. But on the contrary, there are many ways to make it. One can make it such that customers come to drive to the station, but in the parking lots would be filled with people wanting to buy a certain type of gas. By getting some business on the streets, you can easily start this gas station business that is profitable. Also, you can use the extra profit to pay off the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "322. Car Wash. There may not be as much of demand for cars after the holidays, and it may be cheaper to wash the car at home rather then pay for commercial services.\n",
      "\n",
      "323. Video Game Stores. This is a business that can be used in any season.\n",
      "\n",
      "324. Restaurant Business. Restaurant Business can be run with $0 and only need $1500 to get started. This option is more profitable compared to most other business ideas because people eat there and their income is very high because it is very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "325. Electrician. If you are looking to set this up in a residential area, you can start it up for as low as $1500.\n",
      "\n",
      "326. Grocery Store. One could acquire an existing grocery store and convert it for a profit as well. One should expect an initial investment as low as $2000 to convert a grocery store into a fresh food retail store.\n",
      "\n",
      "327. Dry Cleaning and Apparel. Once the start up costs have been covered, you can get all the equipment required to start your dry cleaning business within just $2000. You can even get up to $50,000 to build the store for better profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "328. Lawn mowing and watering. One can start a lawn mowing business for about $2200. Another option is hiring professional landscapers to mow your lawn. This business is definitely not feasible for many because of high rates. But a successful business in this type can make a very good living.\n",
      "\n",
      "329. Laundry Services. $10 a day? How much laundry service do you need? If you do not mind dealing with the customers, this business may be a good option for you, especially if you have a few employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "330. Ice Cream Parlour. Another one that is too cheap to be a profitable business, but it is not too difficult to get up and running. As low as $1000, one is able to make ice creams.\n",
      "\n",
      "331. Jewelry Manufacturing and Retail. This option would certainly require a physical presence to be profitable, but with the proper equipment one could manufacture and sell a jewelry line for as low as $6000.\n",
      "\n",
      "332. Gas Grill. Gas grills are quite profitable during the summer season and moderately profitable during the winter season, making them very feasible for operation. You can set up these gas grills to be used as sit down restaurants and could make about $700 to $1000 profit per week during the summer and winter seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "333. Food Truck. Start with a truck like the Chicken Truck we've selected, and build it into a larger truck. For as low as $10000, you get a truck that's equipped with a restaurant. At the beginning, rent is $1000 (on par with average rent rates in LA) but you can double the price in the end. It's a decent business model.\n",
      "\n",
      "334. Music. One could take a popular song and get it remixed to have it performed by a professional on a stage. The business can go from $600 to $6000.\n",
      "\n",
      "335. Online Stores Business. One could open a small shop on the internet for a small monthly fee. Of course this would require the need for a computer, a domain name and an account. Once one makes the necessary arrangements, one could set up a small store and sell as many products as one can afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "336. Dry Cleaning and Washing service. With a small start up costs, one could save a lot of money to get start up working.\n",
      "\n",
      "337. Hair Stylists. This is not a traditional profitable, yet affordable option, but it’s a must for any girl who needs a new look.\n",
      "\n",
      "338. Cleaning and Care services. This business might need some high priced equipment, but does not need a fancy store that is not always necessary. One could also set up such a business to get as low as $3000. High profit margins could make such a service profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "339. Car washes. Another option is to open a car washes at $1500.\n",
      "\n",
      "340. Barbershop. This is a reasonably lucrative business. One can set up in a small location, getting it up and making the process of a haircut profitable. One can rent a small storefront for about $2000 a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "341. Computer Service. Computer repair is something that is too complex for a company to start out with and the costs would be very high. For as low as $6000, one can make it work. This would also be a medium to profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "342. House cleaning and maid service. From $1000, one can open two cleaning outlets and one maid service branch. With these branches, they can get a substantial amount of business during their busiest season.\n",
      "\n",
      "343. Hair Dyeing. Hair dyeing businesses were once considered not too profitable. This can be changed thanks to the Internet, where there are many businesses that will pay you to color hair. You can use the Internet to check out hair color businesses and then negotiate a business agreement with them for a low price with a high enough profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "344. Lawn Care. One can hire someone to mow their lawn and cut it for half that of an average worker. This provides them with a high margin and could be enough to cover your first and last month's expenses. The lawn care worker could also be paid half the wages of an average worker. Lawn care can also be done for low prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "345. Small Computer Network. If one could find the needed hardware and some software, this business becomes an easy option. Once one could get a few computers, they could start setting up a network. If one did not need the computers much, one could set up a network that would allow the computers and Internet access and then just run this business without buying any computers or Internet service. Of course, the network equipment needed should be fairly cheap to purchase, but the business is not really that profitable. With a\n",
      "\n",
      "346. Car Repair and other similar business that uses parts. Parts stores in particular can become very profitable within a short period of time. Especially if the parts are in short supply in other areas to support the demand of such service centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "347. Auto Shop. This would be a high risk, high risk, low risk venture. One could start a business with as little as $4000 to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "348. Lawn mowing service. This service is quite profitable if demand is great and there is a high demand of mowing service in that area.\n",
      "\n",
      "349. Jewelry and accessories. This option does not require any real skill or knowledge, and all the necessary equipment is around the house, so one could start this business for as little as $500 to $7000 as income.\n",
      "\n",
      "350. Hair Salon. While it is not really profitable, one could set up a hair salon for as low as $2000. The cost of operating a hair salon would not be bad, but the equipment is not too expensive. This option is fairly profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "351. Barbershop. One could buy a barber pole for $500, and make up most of the profit is from the tips generated by haircuts. In order to make a decent amount of profit, one would have to pay the barbers 10% of the amount given for a haircut.\n",
      "\n",
      "352. Auto Detailing. This operation is another option, again not cost of start up, but cost of running the business. This option costs $4000 to purchase the required equipment which then takes $4000/mo to pay for expenses. This would make up the cost of the initial startup for this option.\n",
      "\n",
      "353. Baked Goods Store. One can set up a small bakery on about $2000, buying the necessary equipment for start-ups. This option would be moderately profitable, just not too profitable for a start-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "354. Home-Based Business. The need to open a store is no longer necessary for this type of business. Since it is self-sufficient, one can start small and grow as needed. This is a moderate to low profit possibility, but is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "355. Pet Food Business. Pet foods are a very profitable business, but very hard to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "356. Jewelry Store. This business may require more money to get up and running, but there is no need to incur high expenses to get the business running. For as low as $2000, one can get the business up and running with all the required equipment. This is a somewhat profitable business that demands a considerable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "357. Car washes. To do this, one first does a small cleaning business, then does a small auto-wash business, then does a business for all cars of a certain make & model. This business is a little more profitable, but its a little more money to start and more maintenance on the vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "358. Hair Salon. One can purchase a hair salon for as little as $1500 to start doing hair work. This business is not entirely profitable, as many people do not want their hair cut by an amateur. However, it makes a great home-based option during the recession and a business when the stock market is booming.\n",
      "\n",
      "359. Business Cards. This business could be profitable by operating at a higher level, but does not have to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "360. Grocery Store. This option works for most people that would require low prices. When in a high density market in the suburbs, small grocery stores are quite viable. One would need to make some minor modifications to make this viable from a profit standpoint but it can be easily set up and be set-up to serve a high volume of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "361. Small Cafe. This business is quite profitable for as low as $1500. One need not have a lot of equipment to open this business up, and it is reasonably affordable at as low as the required equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "362. Web design service. A person could set up an email marketing service as a small business for as low as $1500 and get in on the ground floor of internet marketing.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "364. Pet Care Business. This option requires some knowledge on how to run the business, but could cost an as low as $2000 to start the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "365. Lawn Care. When it comes to lawn care, everyone knows that a lawn needs to be mowed once or twice a week. It is a profitable and popular business. One could have a lawn for as low as $6000, and mow it twice a week. Lawn mowing can be done as a weekend venture or by one night a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "366. Biking store. This is another option, because it does not need a store. One can get a bike for as little as $1000 and start biking to earn money. This is quite lucrative and not too expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "367. Cleaner Services. One could setup and operate a company on behalf of cleaning out rooms. There would be no need to advertise or take a license, the idea being that it is not necessary. The owner does not need a store to handle the bookkeeping or the inventory. Total cost:$2000\n",
      "\n",
      "368. Dog walking. This business could be profitable in cities, but would most likely not be a profitable business in rural areas since people would not see the need to go there for their services.\n",
      "\n",
      "369. Lumber Yard or Home Improvement stores. Home Improvement is usually the second best choice if you have to pay for the items out of your profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "370. Ice Cream cart. The minimum start up costs for your ice cream cart business are much higher than most. Starting up requires a little bit of money to get started, but the money is not required for long. It usually takes about three months before the business starts making enough money to cover all the start up costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "371. Restaurant, Cafeteria, Bar, etc. For these options, I've chosen to list out prices above for the same, because the cost of rent could be added. For a small cafe or restaurant this could cost about $3500 to rent a storefront for ten hours a week for a period of one year. This could add $500 a month in rent. When the restaurant or cafe is open, a person could then invest about $2000 in the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "372. Painting and Decorating. One could set up a painting business for as low as $2000, making it profitable. This would not require too much location, since customers would be out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "373. Bakery. A bakery would be a great niche for a startup company. It is one of the largest sectors in the United States. This sector includes bread products. One could purchase the equipment for $4999 and hire the other services, which would work out to about $6000. The investment would also result in higher profits in the long term, which would be greater than the $15000 that one would spend to have an ice cream truck in season in southern California.\n",
      "\n",
      "374. Baking business. This one is a little more profitable than cleaning and service. Depending on location, one can get the required equipment for a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "375. Cleaning and Care service business. This is another option one could consider, depending on demand. Start up costs can begin at about $1500, which is slightly profitable and makes for a viable business. One can also sell their goods at a higher price and make more from the sale of the goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "376. Internet Cafe. Internet cafes do not have a huge demand, but still have the same profitability as other business options.\n",
      "\n",
      "377. Coffee Shop. If one chooses to set up a coffee shop near work, the rent may be too high for the owner to pay, considering that they would have a good number of customers walking in their store looking to buy coffee. This is not an option for a coffee shop near home.\n",
      "\n",
      "378. Grocery Store. The same as #1 above, but instead of it taking up a space, it takes the grocery store space.\n",
      "\n",
      "379. Baking Service. This could take about $3000 to start up and be profitable for a minimum of three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "380. Lawn Care. This is not a business that may be profitable based on its low profit margin. However, one can rent a lawn mower ($500) and set up a lawn care service for as low as $7000. It is moderately profitable, and the low start up costs makes it an easy option.\n",
      "\n",
      "381. Hair and Beauty salons. This option requires a location and a big following and a potential for repeat clientele. With $10,000, one can start this business and get to know it well and start promoting it.

      "\n",
      "395. Online businesses. All online businesses can work on low start up costs, but not all can be profitable. Some offer low monthly profit margins, and others have a profit margin of 0%.

      "\n",
      "396. Floral Boutique. This is a good option if the store is located in a more affluent area with a good variety of products that can cater to a large number of people. These flowers are more perishable, so the profits would be smaller.\n",

      "\n",
      "399. Personal Computer repair shop. One can either open a repair shop or use their service, or buy and pay to outsource at $7000. This is low money that can go for many different business choices, as long as it is a business that can support a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "400. Hair stylist business. This business, is one of those few examples of a high profit margin business, but one that costs almost nothing to enter. A woman can come up with a few hundred dollars to have an appointment with a woman that is a hair stylist. A few dozen dollars goes a long way when done in a short period of time. There are few places that will give free services or advertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "401. Small Business Investment. There are many small businesses that are just starting to earn profits, and not too many that have made an income. The reason for this is that although these businesses start in many ways like others that we’ve outlined in this list of business ideas, the profit rates that they earn are rather low. For for example, an advertising business starts somewhere around the $50,000 mark. But the actual profit that this business makes in an entire year depends on the size of advertising\n",

      "\n",
      "420. Floral shop. One could set up a flower shop and grow their business by expanding the scope of services they provide. The start up cost is as little as $2000, but this option is not feasible because this business requires a high profit margin before they can make some money.\n",

      "\n",
      "427. Ice Cream truck, but with more services. The ice cream trucks in the summer months are really good profit makers. This option is somewhat more profitable, but it requires more work and space. This business can start out as a small company and grow into a large business.\n",
      "\n",
      "428. Barbershop and Hair Salon. Both require a set up costs a small business would like to get out of the way, that is $250 to get the equipment, and for a $3000 or more for start-up and equipment. Both options can be started at $3000, and be profitable.\n",

      "430. Small Restaurant. One could open small restaurant, and have it start as a take out only place.

      "\n",
      "489. Home Decor Shop (a.k.a. Hair salon / Waxing / Cuttings). If one buys a small town home or suburban house to open a hair salon, having a salon shop becomes feasible if demand increases.

      "\n",
      "490. Auto repair shop. One can easily get all the equipment for as low as $6000 to start an auto repair business. This option is very profitable. Low profits are required because one cannot sell cars to a client. This is an ideal business model where you can sell cars in your current location or rent to someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "491. Dog Walkers. As with service, demand depends on location. You could set up a good number of dog walkers, and get a good number of customers, which might net you $3000 per month or $10,000 for a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "492. Floral Design Studio. This business costs less than $3000, but can be very profitable if the flowers are purchased from a reputable and authentic shop that specializes in wholesale flowers, rather than imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "493. Home Services. As low as $5000, one can install carpet, tile or wood floors, and a carpet or tile cleaner starts their home services. As low as $3000, one can install a vinyl and tile shower, and start their cleaning company.\n",
      "\n",
      "494. Dumpster Rental. One could rent a dumpster and start a business renting out those same dumpsters. They could price $12,500 for a large dumpster with four wheels and four arms, and $3500 for the small one with eight wheels and 4 arms. However after the first 30 days, there is not much of a profit, so you will need that money upfront to keep the business running.\n",
      "\n",
      "495. Bakery. One can set up a bakery for as low as $6000, excluding rent. This business is highly profitable because it is easily scalable.\n",

      "\n",
      "497. Music studio. One could get all the required equipment and start their music studio from as low as $1220 to get their music studio running. This option would not be very profitable, but is very viable on an equity loan.\n",

      "\n",
      "499. Auto repair business. One could make a profit in this type of business even with a low budget of $4000-5000, mainly because there are a number of repair businesses that can make you cash. There are many shops that charge an affordable price that can work under the budget of $4000.\n",
      "\n",
      "500. B&B House. This business usually needs a store front, and can be operated on less than $3000.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "505. Restaurant business. This option requires at least a minimum of 200 to 250 square feet of space to get going. This would mean starting up from a small business as soon as possible. The main income is generated by your own food and drinks business, which could be quite lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "506. Video Store. This type of video store would require very little money other than the video equipment. This could even be a franchise business. One can obtain an equipment for such an easy way to open a video store. As low as $2000 can get one up and running.\n",
      "\n",
      "507. Home based online store. One could start this business through a website for an extremely low cost. In a matter of a couple of years, they could make money from this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "508. Photography Studio. One can make money from their photography studios with as little as $5000. An extremely high amount is $10000. For this high amount of money, you must find a large space, which is not too hard to find or rent.\n",
      "\n",
      "509. Coffee Bar. There are many coffee shops that are profitable, so one could open up a similar coffee shop for as low as $1000. One could even offer a special, a cup of coffee at any time for 5 cent. Another option is that all the barbershops around the city could join forces and offer a special coffee service for as much as 85 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "510. Ice Cream Bar. A few ice cream bars can easily make $1000-$3000 each, if one only has to charge 20 cents, which is not too much compared to the retail price of ice cream. Some business cards for $15.\n",
      "\n",
      "511. Dry Cleaning Services. This is obviously a great option, the downside is you have to be the owner, so you need a business license. This option is affordable, but if you are not the owner, it will cost you a lot of money. This business is extremely lucrative if you own the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "512. Music and DJ’s. Music and DJ’s are not very lucrative in South Florida, but it is the most profitable of all options for a store. A $7000 to the store is fairly standard. In addition to regular payments, one can get an additional $10 to $15,000 of personal loans to be used to either pay expenses for the store or to pay off a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "513. Bikes Rental business. One could go with this option since it is pretty profitable and it would not require a store. As low as $8000, one can rent out their bike and have enough money to start up. This would be moderately profitable if a good number of bikes were rented out.\n",

      "\n",
      "516. Carwash/Gasoline Station. This business would be more profitable to operate in warmer climates. By running a gas station, instead of a carwash, the high profit margins in summer months would make up for the lack of profits in winter months. The only time this could be profitable is at the beginning of the year when there is a huge rush of drivers for gas or oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "517. Pet Supplies. One could set up a pet supplies business for as low as $6000 and get the entire inventory up and running. These kind of businesses are not too profitable compared to other business ideas, however they do have a high demand, so it's not hard to get a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "518. Barber Shop. One could start a barber shop for $1600 and get it up and running within a year. For this business, as low as $2500 will do the trick, but one can save enough money from rental charges to have a nice life afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "519. Small retailing stores. There are a few options for this. This business can be a grocery store, a barber shop, a pet shop, etc. The total can even be up to an additional $10,000 to start the business without rent.\n",

      "521. Real Estate. One could purchase some houses and rent out them, but this is not very lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "522. Hair Salon. It would cost around $3000 to start up the business. The same as other hair salons, this business would have to rent. If this same equipment is used to serve hair salons, the customers have more customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "523. Auto Repair. One could rent a car and repair it for as low as $8000 to $10,000 or purchase a small car and repair it for $10,000 or more to start a business. These are fairly profitable.\n",

      "\n",
      "525. Biz services. This business would require a store front, which may cost a pretty large total cost to the company. One could choose the location by using a local service to place your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "526. Auto repair shop. One can even set up the shop as a repair business, which can be more profitable. This would involve buying all the required equipment for their shop and lease it out to them for more profit, taking the total up to about $12500.\n",
      "\n",
      "527. Golf Course. This is a viable option if a small business with relatively low-demand. Although it costs a little more than starting from scratch, this is a viable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "528. A Restaurant/Bar. There needs to be a large amount of demand, for for example a large amount of people who will order the food. In order to maximize profits, one would need to use this space to have a lot of people gather around a table to enjoy the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "529. Grocery Store. One can go for an all-inclusive option for as low as $1500 to start their business. It is moderately profitable, but demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "530. Businesses that offer Internet based online shopping. One needs to set up an e-commerce business for as low as $2000 to become profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "531. Pet Shop. One could buy a pet shop for between $5000-10000 and open it up. In this business the monthly expenses are lower, and there are many profit margins to consider when opening an established business.\n",
      "\n",
      "532. Beauty Pageant. This option requires less capital and has a higher profit margin. These are not many other options.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "534. Housekeeping. If one had the expertise, this could be an excellent business option. The best case scenario is to get a job. The lower cases are to open your own shop without a full time employee and work within your skill level. This works out to be $1380 to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "535. Photography Studio. This option is profitable, because there is demand but not as much as for a photography gallery. The business would require more capital to set up, but could still turn a quick profit of up to $3000 in a few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "536. Home cleaning and care. This option costs about the same of the first two. However, it is very likely that there will be demand. Some people do not have the time to wash their homes and this business can fill the demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "537. Business Card. One could establish a card business for just $3500, a very profitable option, though not very popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "538. Pet Sitting Business. This business could be started for as low as $6000. This could be a highly lucrative option in many business locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "539. Cleaning and Services Business. This is also a good option, but not quite so low cost. It is less profitable, but also less time consuming and less risky. However, it would cost $5000 to $7000 to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "540. Dry Cleaner. One could start this business for as low as $2000 if one does all the cleaning and care work on his own. One would need to bring in enough money to purchase supplies, set up a booth, and advertise in order to make this business a thriving business. The lower the starting up cost, the better the profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "541. Personal Training. It is not too difficult for one to set up a home based training service. A business can be started for less than $1500 and be profitable with a good growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "542. Jewelry business. This business would profit handsomely if they were able to rent a large part of their building and could use a loan to expand their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "543. Coffee shop/bar. One could set up a coffee shop/bar for as low as $5000-$10000 in a small area and get it started up. Coffee is an exceptionally profitable market, and the low start-up costs make it a viable option. This however, demands more employees to handle this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "544. A Hair Studio. A hair salon can be as low as $800 a month. Start-up expenses are minimal and this business would be profitable once a client starts paying a monthly amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "545. Hair Salon. This is probably the most lucrative and profitable business to start a company in the area. $2400 to $3000 can get one started. This business requires more than one person to run, but is quite profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "546. Grocery Store. One can purchase the retail portion of the business for as low as $2000. This makes this option very profitable and easily afforable. The retail store is just the cost of buying the equipment and labor used to run the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "547. Painting and Decorating. This business makes around $1000-$1400 per day, depending on need and location, but this is not a profitable business. So the amount for start up is slightly higher than the two previous options.\n",
      "\n",
      "548. Real Estate. Getting low on real estate may not be worth it, since real estate is typically a low margin business anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "549. Custom Tattoos. One could set up a custom tattoo shop for as low as $2000, excluding rent, taking the total up to about $10,000 to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "550. Hair Salon. For as low as $3000, business can be started. This option is moderately profitable, with high demand because everyone wants a haircut.\n",
      "\n",
      "551. Restaurant. One could open a restaurant and start the business for close to twice what it costs to buy a restaurant, which is about $3500. With a lot of planning and a small store for the cashier, this business can be very profitable as you are starting with a $2000 investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "552. Cleaning Services. All things considered, this is less profitable than a woodworking store, but can be used in locations that are seasonal for the need to be more profitable. With a starting cost of $600 a week, this is a great business to consider for those of you looking to move into starting a business.\n",
      "\n",
      "553. Dog Breeding. In this case it would be wise to get a loan of a few thousand to purchase all the requirements. The costs would come down because of the smaller number of animals to have for the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "554. Internet Marketing. One could set up Internet Marketing for as low as $6000, taking the total up to about $9000 to start up. These are moderately profitable, as are the other businesses listed in this category. But location is a key factor, as there will be competition with other companies in a specific location.\n",
      "\n",
      "555. Real Estate. One can use real-estate investment to start a business and invest. One simply rents their property out and makes money from the rental income. This may require an investment of $10000 and would make one less profitable, because rent on the land is typically the only profit one can get while making it.\n",
      "\n",
      "556. Convenience Store. One does not need too much space to run a business of this type. From 1 – 5,000 square feet, the space can be rented or purchased. This option is quite profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "557. Cleaning and Care Shop. This business does need a store, but for as low as $500 to $700 to start. This also a viable option for businesses that need more revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "558. Real Estate. The rent for real estate is the most difficult to calculate out. For as low as $1000, one can easily start this business. It will take about a year for the business to be profitable, but would return a very high rate of return.\n",
      "\n",
      "559. Painting service. A couple of thousand dollars is all that is needed to get started. The low startup costs are not bad either. Not too expensive and extremely profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "560. Small business manufacturing. One could get a small business to set up a small manufacturing business for as low as $8000, but it can also get set up for under $5000 or under $1500. Small industrial equipment may cost $1000. The profit margins here are higher then the market, but not lower then the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "561. Home Based Business. One could get up and running for as low as $1600 to $2500 depending on the location. With home based businesses, profits depend on location and business, but overall are lower in most situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "562. Hairdresser. People still want to keep their hair beautiful, and this business is the perfect place for them to have the look they desire. This business is quite profitable, but also has its down sides. One needs to be patient and careful while starting and operating this business. For as low as $1500, one can have a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "563. Car sales. There are many cars up for sale at a reasonable price for someone who wants to purchase and resell them. With a little bit of research, one can find cars that one can resell to make good profits, and thus get into the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "564. Cleaning Services. One could start a cleaning services at as low as $3000, which would make it a moderate profit center. These services can be quite profitable if the location is suitable and the staff is well trained.\n",
      "\n",
      "565. Grocery Stores. Grocery stores do not directly compete with other grocery stores or department stores, but they do directly compete with malls and other retail facilities. A grocery store business can cost between $50,000 and $100,000 before rent and other investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "566. Pizza & Subs. One can even set up a \"Pizza Hut\" from scratch for as low as $7000. This business would require the use of all equipment, but if one does, they can get up and running, albeit with a lower profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "567. Restaurant. There are numerous restaurant options available in the city of Calgary, and every city has them. You will never go wrong with fast food with a low quality of food and high costs. This would be an extremely lucrative opportunity for a new business.\n",
      "\n",
      "568. Golf Course Maintenance. For as low as $6000, this would require only as much as a couple of golf carts. This is also a profitable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "569. Construction. One could construct a new construction shop for as low as $3000, and get it up and running within 6-8 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "570. Restaurant. Restaurants are quite profitable, mainly because one can get a high margin, high volume of customers. It may cost a little more to open and operate the restaurant than the ice cream truck business, but the profits are high.\n",
      "\n",
      "571. Realization of a Business opportunity is of paramount importance. Once one selects an idea and finds the perfect space for the business, the loan money will come easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "572. Dry Cleaning. One can go to a dry cleaning store for as low as $3000 and turn it into a lucrative. There is a demand from local people and families that come in for their personal cleanings, but it is very hard to do a dry cleaning in the winter time. This business would be pretty lucrative, as the cleanings are also one of the profitable ventures here, but the season requires careful management, and customers can turn hostile anytime at all because people usually buy a few sheets\n",
      "\n",
      "573. Hair Salon. This option is generally not profitable, costing much more than a similar salon in other areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "574. Construction company. This industry is very lucrative if the building being constructed has already been done. The profit margin could be very high if one chooses to build a factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "575. Cleaning Company. For as little as $2000, one can open business as a cleaning company. This option is very profitable in comparison to other options, but demands to be in a desirable location.\n",
      "\n",
      "576. Home Business, Inc. This company is a profitable one. The average cost to start is $6000, but the maximum cost to start is $50,000. The profit margin is up to 65%, while other businesses may cost around 1%.\n",
      "\n",
      "577. Restaurant. One can always begin a restaurant which can yield quite a profit. They will have to eat, so the low cost of owning the business is great. Rent is not a big issue. As low as $1800 one can open up his restaurant and earn at least $3000-$5000 per month. This will not come to a full year end, so they would need a second source of income from another line of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "578. Restaurant. This is certainly a popular choice, especially in warmer states where the weather is more favorable. Restaurants typically make little to no profit during the summer months and can be very profitable once the weather turns cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "579. Hairdresser. One could set up a hair dresser business for as low as $2000 at a location which would allow the owner to expand that location, which might eventually need to create a second location. The location which would have to expand could then also serve as the location to sell the hair dryer set or other equipment needed for the operation of the hair dryer shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "580. Cleaning and Care service for pets. In this option, again one can get the necessary equipment for a low cost, set up a small store, and start the business. This option can be moderately profitable starting the business alone, or with other friends who offer to buy pets and clean them.\n",
      "\n",
      "581. Dog grooming. One could open a dog grooming business for as low as $3000, excluding rent. This is another moderate option.\n",
      "\n",
      "582. Small grocery stores. This is also a viable option if one lives in a remote area but the economy is good. The most cost effective business would be a small grocery store with a small neighborhood grocery, as per the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "583. Restaurant. The small restaurant might be able to be built for $1000, but even better is the larger scale, or maybe a restaurant chain like McDonald's because it should not be too much to get at least 3 units and maybe also add some features.\n",
      "\n",
      "584. Hair Salon. One could set up a hair salon for as low as $2500 so as to begin their business. It would be quite profitable if it has high competition or demand. A location in your home can be as low as $2500, considering a location in your house to be the area that would have most customer for the longest.\n",
      "\n",
      "585. Barbershop. $2000 is not too much for barbering for two, but it is low to start up and the owner needs to have money for training.\n",
      "\n",
      "586. House keeping. This business could be up and running for a lower price than the above two options. This business needs a lot of space, and if possible, would require a large lot size. For as low as $800, one can open a small business while also saving money.\n",
      "\n",
      "587. Laundry Business. This is extremely profitable. One can create a $4000 business with the necessary equipment and start it without capital and get it up on his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "588. Pet Shops. This business is a little more profitable as it does require a retail location. A standard size pet shop would need $5000 to be set up properly, or $2500 if starting from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "589. Car dealership. The car dealership may be a good business if you are in a good market. If you are in a bad market, then one could take a car dealership into the second option in this series.\n",
      "\n",
      "590. Internet Service Providers. The list of business ideas that need a loan includes internet service providers. One does not necessarily need a store, though people would prefer to have a store. The $7000 option is possible and the $3000 option is a good possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "591. Home-based business. Since one can easily do this with a small investment, the only thing to consider are the hours and location. These are not much profit opportunities, but you can work if you want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "592. Grocery. One could open a grocery store for about $1800, which makes it reasonably profitable. This business is best suited for a large city, but you could always open a small scale store.\n",
      "\n",
      "593. Home Based Business. You may need about $30000 to start up, just to pay rent and electricity, and buy a business loan. A business loan would cover everything needed. Also, you need to have other sources of income such as taking on part time work, working part time for others, contracting for labor etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "594. Bicycles. Buying a bike would cost anywhere from $3000 to $4000, depending upon if the shop is going to need a larger selection of bikes. This would give you much higher profits, but you still would not have that much to pay back on and it would not require large physical assets due to the low initial purchase cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "595. Housekeeping services. These are the house cleaning service. There is not too much demand for this business because it is very expensive to acquire an employee to run the business. The low start up costs would make it feasible for a very low cost loan, up to $500.\n",
      "\n",
      "596. Baking Restaurant. This is very profitable for the business, taking the total up to as high as $18000. The low start up costs makes this one of the best options for start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "597. House Cleaning and Lawn Maintenance. This is another business that would cost almost $4000, which is an average of what it would take to purchase the supplies necessary to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "598. Construction services. This job can be as short as a few months or a few years. A few thousand dollars for as little as a month to start, and then it gets steadily profitable. The total comes out to about $12000 to start up. If you would pay for only a month of work instead of a full year or even 2 years of work, this option is much less than the other options discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "599. Home care. The most expensive way to start this business, would be to lease a private home. This would cost about $30,000. On top of that, the private home would need to be purchased, then the monthly rental and the other expenses would quickly add up.\n",
      "\n",
      "600. Dog Day Care. Any business with low profit margins in the summer season could have the dog daycare business as their only asset. If business is thriving during summer months, one can purchase an additional property to increase profit margins or even have a second property to help expand in the spring and fall seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "601. Real Estate Investing. Another way to get started is to open a real-estate investing venture for the least of $3000 to $5000 dollars. The start up of real-estate investing is more profitable than the other options discussed in this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "602. Hair Salon, which is not really a business of choice in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "603. Video game store. Since video games are quite popular, this is an idea that could work. This store could be set-up for as low as $1300-$1500 for a large area, and the profits are decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "604. Internet Service. Since the customer does not come to the store, the store would no longer need to be a profitable business. Since this is the first in a chain of stores, costs to run it should be lower, and thus profit margin is higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "605. Car Wash. This business does not necessarily need a business building either. One could easily find a car and wash it for as low as $4000/week. As the business gets bigger, the cost will go down.\n",
      "\n",
      "606. Hair Salon. One could set up a shampoo and conditioner business for as low as $27000.\n",
      "\n",
      "607. Computer Repair shop. One could get a basic computer repair shop setup for as low as $2000. The equipment is not much to start though, which makes it a decent business.\n",
      "\n",
      "608. Home repair and maintenance. If one were to put a mobile repair shop on the corner of the road, this business could be profitable and profitable at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "609. Barber Shop. This business does not usually need a store, as long as you can be physically present. As low as $1500, one can setup a barbershop business. One can purchase a new shop or lease an existing one.\n",
      "\n",
      "610. Cleaning store or service business. By hiring an employee, one could get a cleaning service going for $3000 to $6000. This is not very profitable, but for big cities, small start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "611. Lawnmower Repair Service. One could set up this service and charge customers about $1500. This does not necessarily need a business of any size but this is a good money earner.\n",
      "\n",
      "612. Restaurant. For as little as $750 one could buy a franchise of a large restaurant with a high profit margin. The owners could get the required equipment and start up their business. As the profit margin is high, this is a very profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "613. Car Dealership. In this option one would be required to have a few vehicles. You only need two, but they each come with an average lifetime of around 10 year. That means that you get them out in 5-6 years. You still need some money, but in the long run it can be profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "614. Home Care/Personal Care. A home care business like this costs from as little as $2500 to as much as $5000. Here the demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "615. Golf Cart Business. One could purchase a golf cart from a local or state golf course and use it when needed. Some golf courses will pay cash for golf carts, some will reimburse the cost of renting a cart. They use them for their recreation or for showing visitors around. These carts are very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "616. Personal care services. One could start this business as low as $1500 per month when one rents their house and pays for everything from cleaning and dishwashing to meals, which adds up to about $3500 per month. The money earned could be used to pay off the loan, because a business with a low profit margin cannot afford to take a personal loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "617. Dry Cleaning. One can get a dry cleaning service for less than $2000 to start the business. The dry cleaning business in itself can be profitable and the customers could increase with future improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "618. Home Diner. The minimum start up costs for a home diner is quite high, but this should not deter from the idea. With such minimum spend, one can do quite well with this business (about $3500 in the beginning) even though it is not as profitable as one would expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "619. Cleaning and Care services. One could buy a cleaning service contract for as low as $4000 to make a business plan that would work well and cost low. This option is moderately profitable, as cleaning businesses are most profitable during the warmer months.\n",
      "\n",
      "620. Laundry. Laundromats were common prior to the 20th century. But by using washing machines one could make this business a huge profit in winter, because clothes could be laundered or cleaned at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "621. Lawn Care and Handyman services. One could run these at low cost of $3000 to $4000, and get to work immediately and provide better financial returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "622. Pizza. There are a plethora of pizza restaurants in the United States, with a myriad of options for pizzas. For as low as $1000 one could get started in this business. It is not too profitable as the low start up costs will limit the profit from selling the product, but a $2000 investment is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "623. Home & Garden services. This is the best option as far as profitability but it would cost you more than $4500. A home and garden store does not have to be in a rural area, however it does cost a good deal more to buy one.\n",
      "\n",
      "624. Auto Repair shop. One can easily get all the equipment needed which would cost a little more than $5000. However, this must be located in a relatively quiet area and could get quite busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "625. Photography. For as low as $1500, one can set up a business as a photographer right off of the street. Though not as profitable as the other options, this option is still worth considering.\n",
      "\n",
      "626. Ice Cream Shop. This business is an option if one is willing to lease the space. It is moderately profitable, but if one does not wish to make a sizable investment in the start up of the business, it would be a viable plan also.\n",
      "\n",
      "627. Bar. One can start their own bar in their backyard for as low as $6000. This is not a high-profit business either, but does allow a person a chance to earn even more money.\n",
      "\n",
      "628. Car Wash. For a business to make a profit, you need to be able to charge more for your service than for the item you are washing (like cars) because that makes up such a big portion of your sales. To charge only 75% of the amount of the service requires to make the sale, one should probably charge $250 for the price of the item. This amounts to an annual profit of $4,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "629. Personal care and services. This may cost a bit more in start up, but once the business is up and running, it is profitable as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "630. A health or exercise center. A small room for as low as $1500 would do and is highly affordable. This is also a medium-profit business, which becomes profitable in a few months. This business is very successful, but one has to depend on others to do most of the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "631. Coffee Beanery. One can set up an ice cream/coffee shop for as low as $7000 to start up, if necessary, with the additional equipment and space requirement for a coffee shop. This business is quite lucrative and will be profitable, but demand will be dependant on current local market trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "632. Lawn Care. This service is highly profitable, and the customers can walk themselves, or they can rent equipment and clean and maintain the property. This could become a lucrative option if the area is saturated.\n",
      "\n",
      "633. Beauty Salon. This is a quite profitable business. This one does not necessarily need to have a store, but having one can definitely increase the profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "634. Cleaning out a storage locker. The business is not very profitable, but needs the space. You can get one for as low as $500 a month to start the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "635. Personal Care Services, Hair Salons, Massage Parlor etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "636. Custom Design business. One could sell custom products without a store. If the products are profitable enough, one can easily raise money from a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "637. Hairdressers. This business does not necessarily need a storefront, a good location or good reputation. One can find these shops for as low as $500 plus all the required equipment. These are moderately profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "638. Video Production. With this type of business, there is no start up cost. One could purchase and hire a person to run this type of business for as low as $6000 in total. These are the most profitable business in terms of total profit, taking up $12000 to $12500 per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "639. Web site design services. One can take their business to the online market to get more profits. Start it at as low as $6000 and increase it by increments of 20. This is not necessarily a business. There is no sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "640. Concrete and Masonry services. This business is a bit unpredictable, but it will make money most of the time, and it could increase its profits if additional locations are added. This one is always profitable, but does not require much money, and could be bought with low down payment, with even low down payment loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "641. Restaurant. For as low as $5000, one could start their first restaurant. This option is pretty profitable and is great place to get an in-house chef to provide meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "642. Hair Cutting. A hair cutting salon could cost about $6000 to start with. A typical salon can take in about 10% (5\n",
      "\n",
      "643. Auto and truck repair. This option has lower profits due to the high cost of required equipment and the long period of time that would take in order to repair the vehicles. One can purchase an auto repair shop, buy used cars, or build a new one with used parts. The profit margins for the above options would drop due to the amount that would be spent for making repairs, and for buying and making repairs. In order for this business to be profitable, the shop would likely need to be located\n",
      "\n",
      "644. Business Directory. Many businesses that do not need a store can use a directory to advertise their business. Advertising can be cost effective. For as low as $2500, one could hire several employees and advertise their business on the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "645. Pet Food and Pet Supplies. This is another business that does not necessarily need a store. As much as $5000 could afford this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "646. Grocery Stores. One could run a grocery store for as low as $4500, even including rent. One could also run a grocery store without a shop out front, such as a converted garage, and still open for business.\n",
      "\n",
      "647. Music CD store. One could operate a music CD store using CDJs (cassette players for storing compact discs). CDJs costs the most of these options. This business would possibly be profitable for as low as $5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "648. Hair Salons, Tattoo Shops, and Massage Clinics. One could set up these businesses for as low as $2500. They are not too profitable, but the start up cost is low. If one chooses the massage clinic location for a more established location, the demand will definitely increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "649. Barber Shop. This could be a small business in the lower, middle or higher income brackets. The starting capital for this business is less that $2000. But the investment of this money will generate a high yearly income. The profit on a barber of $1000 per year is only $20. The most profitable business of this option is the one that reaches a higher income bracket with the new money and has a substantial amount of time left over.\n",
      "\n",
      "650. Home based catering. With the internet, this business can be set up at as little as $1000 and start running their business. Depending on location, demand for this would be low, but this would be a high-profit margin business.\n",
      "\n",
      "651. Jewelry Making. Even with only $3000, one can make one to two hundred dollars in profit per month. You will need a good location to compete.\n",
      "\n",
      "652. Pizza and Subs Places. These are not really a business, but they can be run by a single person with some very cheap supplies. For as low as $5000 there are a whole lot of services which would be suitable for this type of business such as pizza delivery, ice creams, and other beverages. These require no large capital to purchase the supplies to open up the business, thus making it profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "653. Ice Cream Bar. This business could be set up with for as low as $1000 for a simple ice cream bar, which is probably not profitable.\n",

      "654. Pet food manufacturing. This is a profitable business, and could make more from a $5\n",
      "\n",
      "655. Music Studio (dance club). $3000-$5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "656. Bookkeeping and Accounting. This is a business where money could be saved by not having a store. All one needs is a small office inside or outside of a business. These businesses do not generally require a store since the bookkeeping and information is all on the computer. It can be as much as 1-10% less. If not, one would have to rent one a store since they could have it inside and outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "657. Restaurant. One could purchase a restaurant as a very low priced way to start an outbound loan, but should not have a very high total cost. A single meal out could cost a little over $400 a person in most cities. This is a profitable business, but the overhead costs are very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "658. Hair Salon. It can take up to $18000 for a salon to be started. It would take at least 2-3 years for a new salon to break even, if you go for the first year, you could recoup $6000 and the rest of the time, you could make $12000. If you would choose this option, then it is ideal and affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "659. Auto Mechanic shop. This is my last idea, as I know you guys would not like. But I am writing this because some of these businesses are not that profitable since they need much more machinery to run. One can purchase as a small car repair shop, for example for as low as $10,000 and take it up to $15,000 to start it up. This is the most profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "660. Lawn Care. One can start this business up from about $3000 and work their way up to $10000 or even more. This option works better in summer months than in winter months.\n",
      "\n",
      "661. Cleaning and Care services. This business does require an office, which means they would almost always need a loan. For as low as $3000, one could buy the office equipment and set up shop. This option is relatively successful, but requires a higher loan to get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "662. Cleaning and Care services. Similar to that of the previous option, but slightly lower price.\n",
      "\n",
      "663. Real Estate. I would not suggest starting your own home-based business in real estate, as such a business would probably need to be a lot bigger than 1 or 2 employees so one could easily fail. However, many people are thinking of opening this type of business and I will explain why they are wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "664. Laundry Shop. One could set up a business for as low as $3000 and make a very good profit doing laundry on a weekly basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "665. Small home electronics store. This option can be as low as $5000, and is also quite profitable for a little retail business.\n",
      "\n",
      "666. Lawn Care. One could purchase a lot with lawn, and rent out that. This is the most profitable and most widely accepted among all the above businesses. The minimum cost to start is around $1500.\n",
      "\n",
      "667. House Painting. This business does not have too many expenses, and can become quite profitable in a few days. Ofcourse you may have to work some overtime hours, but this business could be profitable to start as low as $600 a week!\n",
      "\n",
      "668. Laundry. Laundry is an excellent choice. One could start with a few $300 suits and get them laundered and turned into cash overnight for very little money. With the business up and running, one could turn the money into even more clothes to sell. These are some of the richest businesses that you could ever start.\n",
      "\n",
      "669. Bait Shop. This is another business where a store is not needed. A small bait shop that does not advertise in advance can sell bait for a profit. This is not a good way to start if one has no customers, but can be a good way to diversify.\n",
      "\n",
      "670. Auto Detailing and Service. One could run this business for as low as $2000. This would be one of the least profitable options, for this reason one should consider renting space if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "671. Dog Boarding Business. If one is living on a large enough lot or has room in their home, they can easily rent one. The drawback to this is the high start up cost of the business. The other drawback is high initial cost at which the entrepreneur may experience loss which then becomes more attractive towards higher profit margins. This would be a business for people with large lots of property or with plenty of room in their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "672. Restaurant. An excellent option for a fast and profitable business is to open a casual restaurant. One could have a good reputation for customer service and excellent food, with a good and happy staff. They can bring in revenue up to $6000 a month, depending on the location, as such, a fast and very profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "673. Business school. For as low as $2000 to $3000, one can start a business on their own with little investment. This option is moderately profitable, but depend on the location.\n",

      "\n",
      "675. Bikes. This option is not very profitable but one would be able to lease these as rental bikes. The rental for as low as $2000 would make it possible to start one for less than $100/month.\n",
      "\n",
      "676. Laundry and Ironing Services. You would need to rent a space (around $1500) to start up these types of businesses. The rent can easily be covered by savings from a tax-free savings account, and is not expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "677. Golf shop. This could run up to about $5000, which is not that profitable. However, there could be a number of golf courses nearby, which could make one's business profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "678. Pet-Gone. One could invest as less as $800 for a pet-gone business, which could have profits in the range of $3000. The profits of this business greatly depend on the need of the animal clientele, which would be lower if a human clientele is interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "679. Golf Shop. This type of business requires lower start up costs and lower initial investment requirements. For as low as $3200, one can start with a good amount of capital invested. This is moderately profitable, but only if demand can meet up with supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "680. Diving and Snorkeling Business. There are many different businesses to start, but one can start a diving and snorkeling business for as low as $900 and get it started. The low start up and low overhead can make this option quite profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "681. Web sites. This option is not a profitable option; however, it may be the next best option if one does not have much of a personal budget. One can have a website for $3000 for as long as one would like to have it. This is the low cost solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "682. Web Design Company. This one is not the best choice as it is too time consuming to update a website. As such, this option is best suited for small companies that have limited time and resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "683. Pet Shops. One can buy two pet shops for $2800, that includes equipment and running costs. This makes it quite profitable, considering the profits from the first two options.\n",
      "\n",
      "684. Dry Cleaning Studio. This can actually generate quite a amount of income. It is a business where the main point of operation is providing dry cleaning services to the public. One could set up a dry cleaning store and use it as a place where the public can come and pick out all their dry cleaning. This would cost about $7000 to start up and would be a moderately profitable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "685. Car Dealer. The best car business. This can be a profitable business, but need the most money, as the sales person will be paid $300 a day. A better car business could be found for as low as $1000.\n",
      "\n",
      "686. Tires and Rims. One can purchase a used car that has over 100,000 miles and sell it to a buyer who is willing to pay that amount. This would be one of the least profitable but most lucrative of all options since one does not have to pay for the loan on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "687. Drones. Drones could be very competitive with other industries, especially when they offer insurance, repair services and are more durable. A business could be started for as low as $2500. This is moderately profitable, but could be tough depending on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "688. Personalized Products. This business would be able to use the products generated in the shops, and if prices are not too high, then it can be quite profitable. For as low as $1000, one can make a decent profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "689. Funeral Home. This business is not too profitable, but could make a great profit if you had a large consumer base. As an example; a funeral home based business can make about $20,000 a year profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "690. Coffee Shop. This business is not too profitable, because of the high operating costs and high minimum wage needed in the market. For the same amount, one can get a bigger business to increase profits. For the same amount, one can choose not to run the coffee shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "691. Bunkhouse. This would require the owner to start a separate business and has a lower potential for profit. The profit is about the same as the clean service but would probably take longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "692. Hair salon. For $3500, a woman can get a hair salon with only a little training and equipment to get started. This business is very profitable by the end of the year, although it can take up to two years to make a profit.\n",

      "694. Office Work. One could start up an office work as low as $3000. This option is moderately profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "695. Dog washing. You will need an enclosed building for this, so you will be limited to a location in Florida. You will probably need to purchase equipment, which could cost as low as $700. This is a low cost option, but low demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "696. Ice Cream Store with Slideshow. One could setup the same exact business as above, but start at a lower price per unit on the equipment. This costs $2000 to start, which is less than that of the ice cream store.\n",
      "\n",
      "697. Food Truck. One could get a food truck which is fairly cheap, say $6000, and have it up and running within 7-10 days. This would be a more profitable option if the area is quite crowded. The drawback if there is not much demand.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "699. Car Care Services. This business does not necessarily need a store, which would save a lot of money. For as low as $3000, one could have a small garage business with gas powered tools and power tools. The garage space could be used for display and marketing such as tshirts, etc. To start this operation you only need some tools. For example, for $1500 you could get power toothbrushes and for $2000 you could get vacuum cleaners. You can also put up an advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "700. Duct Cleaning Inc. One could have the ability to get these services for $600/d. This will save a lot of money for a small business owner without a store.\n",
      "\n",
      "701. Personal Stocking Service. This business is most lucrative around Valentine's Day because this is a holiday that is used as a promotional tool. One could offer personalized gifts during these times by offering customers to sell personalized stockings and mugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "702. A Pizza restaurant in North Seattle. While a pizza restaurant in Seattle is profitable, it's only moderately profitable, and the profit margins are much lower than most restaurant businesses in Seattle.

      "\n",
      "703. Lawn Care services. These are not necessarily high profitmaking businesses. The most profitable business is a mower & grass cutter. You could start at about $3000, or more if there are lots of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "704. Computer Repair and Service, and Computers. Although the start-up costs are high to start one of these businesses.

Once one can prove himself, one can start selling his productions as they need to be created. This business would yield a little more profit for a start up\n",
      "\n",
      "710. Pizza Hut. This fast food service is the most profitable one and also has the least start up cost. As a pizza place could cost as low as $2.7000, you would get in as soon as possible and could even wait for the opening of the counter to start operating. This is a highly profitable business with many more franchises being sold per year that does not require a startup cost. After purchasing your franchise, you can easily turn your business into a high profit restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "711. Car/Bike Rental service. One does not need a business license if their business is located in a community where they have a long-term contract with the residents. Although this option is not very profitable at most, they do not need to buy a vehicle and rent a bike.\n",

      "712. Home based Baking business. These are not too profitable, but the low start up costs make this business profitable. For as low as $3000, one can get all the required equipment and start their business. This option is moderately profitable, but demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "713. Hair Salon. One can start off as low as $1000 because it will take most of the money up front. This is a profitable business, but not without work.\n",

      "714. Pet Sitting. In this business, one could obtain a room with pets available. This can be an all inclusive service, with no furniture required, and costs ranging anywhere between $1000 and $5000 (depending on the amount of pets one is willing to bring.\n",
      "\n",
      "715. Cleaning services. This business offers a variety of cleaning services, and could be considered for this option if demand grows along with interest rates. On the other hand, a lower rate of interest might make the low cost of start up prohibitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "716. Construction and Landscaping. If one decides to go for construction, one would have to work for at least $4000 to even go in business. If one decides to landscaping instead, the starting costs could be as low as $2000.\n",

      "\n",
      "719. Hair cuts. One can set up a salon for as low as $50 per day, including a day in advance. This is profitable throughout the year, but the low start up costs make it fairly affordable on a loan.\n",

      "\n",
      "725. Internet Marketing. This is the single most effective business idea, for low as well as high risk, and could prove to be the single most profitable business idea to start.

      "\n",
      "727. Real Estate. One could start a real estate business as low as $6000 to get it up and running, and to maintain it, which would cost about $3000. As the profit margin is very low, this option is quite successful and affordable.\n",

      "728. Hair Salons. One could start their own hair salon for as low as $12000 and have a profitable and growing business as it is growing. With this option, there is no need to get a loan because one can make one’s own money.\n",
      "\n",
      "729. Baking Stores. As good as these would look with a fancy building, for only $3000, one can start this business. This business is almost to the point of becoming a full-time job. For as low as $1600 to $2000, one can find a suitable location and start this business. While the profit margins are quite low, due to high labor cost, these stores can create a comfortable living, which includes a high income.\n",
      "\n",
      "730. Auto Repair Services. One may also get an auto repair shop and the start up costs would be lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "731. Florist. One would have to pay a small salary upfront to rent the plant upfront and to hire the employees to make the plant, which would create a small inventory to pay the rent for the plant up front. This option is fairly profitable, considering that the product is easily sold, and the flowers look more beautiful after processing as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "732. Beauty Salon. This option is the most profitable, but the demand would be minimal. However, considering it does not take much investment to start up this business, one may still find it profitable.\n",

      "733. Auto detailing.\n",
      "\n",
      "734. Laundry Services. One could get as low as $800 to start up a laundry. This does not necessarily need a store. However a $500 starting investment will produce profits of $900 a year. On top of that, the profits are about the same whether you work 10 hours or 70 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "735. Office space. It is feasible and economical for owners of a new office space. However, demand for this is usually not as high because of competition. This option is only slightly profitable and can be considered an extra expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "736. Car Wash. One can invest as low as $2000 and open a car wash that is profitable. This is a niche market in the city, but is becoming more popular every year.\n",

      "\n",
      "738. Custom Designing Business. One could get custom equipment and run the business like a sewing shop using fabrics that were available in the stores. The cost of buying the equipment would be at least equivalent to what they would pay for an average retail store. On average, this would be a profitable venture, if the stores are located near where the designer lives. This business option is very profitable; however, the most profitable location would be in a town with a high population due to demand of designers.\n",

      "\n",
      "744. Grocery Stores. This one looks a lot more profitable than cleaning services, but it also depends on what kind of items you sell. This could make you a profitable business if you are dealing with fruits, vegetables, meats, and other foods. Grocery stores can be as low as $5000.\n",

      "748. Food delivery service. One could set up a food delivery service for a couple of as low as $5000, excluding rent, and get it up and running.

      "\n",
      "749. A Video Business. One could purchase only one video system for $5000 and start up. A video system can be sold at $400 per month which is profitable, but this business is most definitely a high stress work environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "750. Cleaning and Care services. When starting the business, one would require an additional person to operate for about $1200 yearly, although one could probably cut down on employees and still get the same amount of income. However, since this is a fairly good business to start, one would be required to add a salesman to the staff, and possibly purchase an additional cleaning service\n",
      "\n",
      "751. Book Shop. As above, one could set up a book shop for about $400 per month. However, books are also in demand in summer months, making this business more profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "752. Small Restaurant. One could get a restaurant for as low as $2000 and start the business right away. Low risk, but a large income with a small investment (of $2000 - $5000) to start up the business can be very lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "753. Funeral home. This is an easy to start business. For as low as $2000, one can build a basic funeral home and start out. There is a huge demand for these services.

      "754. Auto Maintenance Services. This business does not necessarily need a store, which saves money. For as low as $1000, one could get all the required equipment and start their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "755. Business that uses local goods. One can start up this business which may cost a little more. For instance, one could get a local company to use their building and install their goods. For as low as $2500, one could get the start up costs with the required equipment and staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "756. Coffee Roast. This option is also one of the low-cost options. This business can start with only $250 to get up and working, and then expand to more in-demand customers. This is still a fairly profitable business, but demand is very limited and is dependent on high coffee consumption in your area.\n",
      "\n",
      "757. Convenience Store. One can open this business for as low as $1500 to start this business. This can be set up in a location like a shopping mall, where the space is in excess of the number of shops.\n",
      "\n",
      "758. Dry Cleaning. This business is not profitable during the summer months because of high overhead costs and very high summer demand. For as low as $2500, one can run the business, although it requires a little upfront investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "759. Confectionary. With this business, one can start with very little and can expand to much more if they wish. This is also a profitable option, but demand also depends on location.\n",

      "\n",
      "762. Auto Repair and Maintenance service. This option may be very profitable because one will often have a large margin of profit when it comes to repairs. For as low as $1500 to $5000 one can repair, and even make it new once the cost is recovered. This option is moderately profitable, but not as profitable as the auto repair business.\n",
      "\n",
      "763. Electrician. For as low as $5000, one can get all the required equipment and start their own business. It is very profitable during summers as demand is higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "764. Web design and marketing company with a website. This business would need a domain name, hosting and access to online storage. This business will start with an amount as low as $2500-$3000. This business is moderately profitable, as long as you have a decent website that converts well.\n",
      "\n",
      "765. Photography services. This would be profitable if there were a demand for taking beautiful photos. The cost for this could be $250 to $500 to operate for six months. There is a high turnover rate; with the new customers having already seen the money. In a high profit margin business, this would be most viable, but most likely only profitable until the money was spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "766. Pet Shops. For a $700 loan, one can open a pet shop. The only downfall to this business is that it only covers a specific time period, e.g.- dogs food, flea comb, cat foods etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "768. Photography studio. This business would require you to get an actual building for the purpose, and you could do so for less than $3000. The profit margins for this business are high since these people are earning a good wage from their photography work.\n",
      "\n",
      "769. Construction company. One could set up a construction team with one employee for as little as $400 per week. This is a high end option.\n",

      "\n",
      "771. Bookstore. With $5000 for equipment, book store is a feasible option for one interested in starting a business, provided one makes the right kind of book choice. If one chooses the right book choices, a book store can be a good option. However, most books are also bought by people, and they can be more expensive. Hence, book store is not going to be a profitable or an afforable venture in most situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "772. Funeral Shop. One could set up a funeral shop as low as $7000 to start it and as high as $20,000 to operate it. A location near a school and hospital would be optimal. Funeral shops are profitable in the early stages, but do not always need high profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "773. Hair Salon. Hair salons are always a good business to start up with a little capital. Once a business is up and running, an additional capital of $300 to $1000 can be raised to increase production. The money to raise will come from outside sources, such as a line of credit or from a loan.\n",

      "777. Hair Stylist\n",
      "\n",
      "778. Bait and Tackle. One could open a business selling bait or fishing tackle. This business can be very profitable, since people might be willing to eat fish that are caught in their bait store. However, this type of business would have a higher risk of failure.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "782. Barber ShopThis business does not require a fancy building, but rather just a place to work. This business also does not require a brick and mortar location, so it can be a one man operation for a very low cost. The one man business can also generate some extra income if he decides the shop is not doing too well. This option also does not require a high inventory, which is less costly to keep. As an extra income, it is also good to have people who can come in and\n",

      "\n",
      "784. Convenience store. This business is good for a variety of customers. One could open a convenience store and have about $10000 of income generated per month by selling the products that customers would usually purchase at supermarkets. One could sell soft drinks, beer, cigarettes, as well as other convenience items and other merchandise. This would be a decent business idea as long as one makes it look professional, which one would be able to do by opening up a store, which has minimal costs associated with operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "785. Video Game Playing/Selling. One could set up an internet retail business. One could start as low as $800 and do quite well. This option is cost effective as one does not need much capital to start, but if done the right way is definitely lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "786. Hair Styling. One could make up to $100000 doing these services. The only problem with this option is when one has to find the right customers and when one can afford it.\n",
      "\n",
      "787. Restaurant. One can acquire a good restaurant for as low as $100 to obtain all the necessary equipment. These restaurants may not be for everyone, but they are an excellent opportunity to set up your own franchise.

      "\n",
      "788. Pizza Hut. One could go the pizza chain and make their pizza as low as $3000 per pizza. However, for a single, small pizzeria with four employees, who are expected to work 40 hours per week, this would be an extremely profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "789. Hairdressers. This type of business does not require much investment in equipment because haircuts are done with scissors and straight razors. One could spend as little as $600 on this and get started with the business. This is a moderately profitable business, but depends on the location.\n",
      "\n",
      "790. Internet Cafes and Cafing. These are businesses that can provide good services. They are very profitable, except that they might require more capital as well. $3,000 would be required for just the furniture at one, but could easily come up to $10,000 for a whole home business (as mentioned by others, a home business is actually a full fledged business that requires capital)\n",
      "\n",
      "791. Pizza or Chinese. One could either choose one of the two or both. One can either go to either Chinese stores or take a pizza to order. Chinese do not have to charge a set price, which means lower costs, but at the same time, the pizza is not as profitable as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "792. Cleaning services. One could start a cleaning service by having a small area at home where they could vacuum and sort. One could then hire a cleaner to do what is needed. One would need some additional area, such as a home or apartment, which could cost a little more than $3000.\n",
      "\n",
      "793. Hair Styling/Fashion Salon. A simple salon could be opened for as little as $3000, for as long as one needs the services. A low-profit business, such as this one, could offer good returns for a small investment.\n",

      "794. Restaurant. One could open up a highly profitable restaurant for $2000. Rent would be $400 and food and beverages costs would be $800. The total would be $1200. One can expand for many more people for more profits. However, high maintenance and high food costs should be considered in expansion with other people. This option could be a good option for start up, but should be avoided for expansion or even for more food vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "795. Home Cleaning and Repair. One could purchase a set of new and properly cared for washing and drying machines for about $2500. This is quite profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "796. Video store. You could start by renting video tapes for a price of $200, this will not bring in too much money. You could also buy them at the retail price and run the video store.\n",
      "\n",
      "797. Beauty Salon. This business can be run from home with a small investment and can be profitable, especially during summer months. During the winter months, you use the extra revenue gained. The business does not actually have to store anything as the services are done at your convenience.\n",

      "803. Internet Services. This business would have a low start up cost, but could still be a huge success if the demand does not go down. These services can make you money, but not on a daily basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "804. Dry Cellar restaurant. If operating a restaurant with less than 50 regular customers, one can get as little as $400 to $500 to create their own menu. This option is moderately profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "805. Hair Shops. These shops are very profitable because the rent for a barber who works for the shop is inexpensive. A barber would work from home instead of the shop, and the shop does not require a sign. The business would require $6000 to start up, as well as sign.\n",
      "\n",

If other pets will require frequent attention (dog, cat, or rabbit), then increase the demand to attract customers. This is not a good option on a low start-up budget, which allows the high profit margin of these service jobs.\n",

      "810. Restaurant. Low initial start up costs make this possibility a feasible option. The average restaurant starts at about $3000, but this can increase. Another way to calculate that, if you will be starting it in a year (the same as with business idea #1).\n",
      "\n",
      "811. Bunk Beds. One could set up a business renting out sleeping bags for as low as $400 to as high as about $1000, depending on the location. Again, this is not very profitable, but can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "812. Pet Clinic. This is a good option if you plan to run the clinic in your own residence with only one person. If you plan to run it in a facility, the start up cost is higher, but should be lower than $3000. You will also need to have more than just a license if you want this business to be sustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "813. Auto Shop. One could purchase an auto shop, and start it up for as low as $4000. Because it is not necessarily cash generating, it is not likely to be feasible and the monthly payments would probably be excessive.\n",
      "\n",
      "814. Video Game store. This is a very competitive business that is not a quick and easy option to start. However, with $10000, one could have a complete business on the go by springtime. Once the store is established, one could lease out the floor for a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "815. Custom Bike Builds, One could set up a custom bike shop for as little as $3000 and not have to pay rent. Custom bikes are very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "816. Cleaning Services. One could start with a small cleaning business and gradually grow it. Low start up cost makes this possible, but this business has lower profits because of its low margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "817. Personal Services. This business does not necessarily need a store, which saves money, and can be set up very easily for as low as $3000. The potential profits are very dependent on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "818. Hair salon. This business does not necessarily require a store. Hair-cutters do not need an office, and it will be very easy to keep track of all the appointments. This business can be profitable up to about $6000.\n",
      "\n",
      "819. Hair Salon. One could get a salon for as low as $2000 and get one started. There are numerous locations that are too popular for many to open their own. The low cost of labor for new entrants in a growing industry is the strongest driver for entry. A salon has a high profit margin, compared to other options, such as a store.\n",
      "\n",
      "820. Restaurant/Bar. For as low as $40000, one could set up a restaurant/bar and get it off the ground. The profit margins are high, but in order to open a restaurant, one will need to buy certain items like seating to start. In this case one needs to either have a lot of money invested, or the restaurant will need to be very popular in order to make a profit. One also cannot go too big or lose money.\n",
      "\n",
      "821. Airline Pilot. As long as there are passengers, this option is feasible for a lot lower cost than most of the above options. Flight time from a major cities like Los Angeles, to New York City is only an hour, so most people are not in a rush. If there are more passengers involved, the business could turn into a great opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "822. A Restaurant. Again, all the equipment needed to make a decent restaurant can be purchased for as little as $2500 and still make enough profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "823. Bar Brothels. This is a risky venture, but the potential for high profits makes it worth pursuing. One could start a business that offers sex for a fee and charge 10% tax. By only charging the minimum $100 per act, one can make $50,000 of profit per month with no overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "824. Hair Salon. Salon costs are reasonable, so one can start this business at as low as $1000 for a single. A low end salon can also provide hair lessons and get more customers with discounts during winter months. These are not necessarily very profitable, due to the fact the start up costs are generally quite high.\n",
      "\n",
      "825. Personal Care & Service. The total start up costs for a personal care business start at about $6000 and then depends on the particular person and the type of service that will be given. This business does not necessarily have to have a store to be profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "826. Lawnmowers, lawn, garden, landscaping services\n",
      "\n",
      "827. Coffee Shop. A coffee shop will cost as low as $6000 in the beginning, but it should be able to start on $4000 to $5000. If they cannot save, they could get a loan to start up. This is not a profitable business with demand for high profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "828. Web-hosting business. One could choose to get a web-hosting business up and running for as low as $5000. This business is moderately profitable, but needs to be near a major city to support the operation. A loan will allow for this option.\n",
      "\n",
      "829. Concrete Piling. One could set up their own concrete piling business for as low as $7000 if they would have enough experience. This option is moderately profitable, but a little more high risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "830. Construction Site. There are many of these in the United States but in smaller towns, the construction sites are not large and there are few customers for the services of the small businesses. That being said, there are still businesses that work on construction sites. These are usually less lucrative then the above businesses, but still profitable. However, if the construction sites are not viable, one may need to start out with smaller start up costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "831. Restaurant. Once your shop becomes more successful, you could set up your own restaurant. Once you get a steady clientele, you can set up your own location. This will be the same as any other business, so costs are not important to the profitability of that particular idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "832. Home delivery business. Get one or two cars to distribute your products for free, and with the price of gas and the cost of food, one can make quite a significant income with this type of business. You can also set it up in a garage, make extra money driving it for customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "833. Barber Shop. One could have a barbershop for as low as $2500 and start working as soon as they have their equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "834. Painting Business. If you can start at least $3000, you can set up an art shop for yourself in your own home. People are willing to pay a low sum of money to have their home decorated. At $4000, you can hire a couple of art students and start your own business. Paint for this business has low profit margin, and this business too has high demand because of its nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "835. Bakery. One could rent an empty bakery to get money by working it off. This is a moderately profitable business with high demand during the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "836. Dog grooming. This business is low profitable, but quite feasible. One could get a dog groomer for $3000, and then just keep grooming as a sideline to one's primary business. The other benefits of this type of business is no location cost and no location restriction.\n",
      "\n",
      "837. Hairdresser/Nail Salon. A clean up business is always profitable. One can start the clean up business from scratch with $10-$15, and the rest can be paid as additional expenses, making it lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "838. Coffee House. One could set up a coffee house for as low as $12000, excluding rent, taking the total up to about $20 thousand. This business has a higher chance of profitability because it’s a local business which requires high profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "839. Beauty Salon. As low as $1000 may be acceptable and may give one a good start into this business. The business is not too profitable, but the location gives one the ability to expand their business, thereby generating higher profit margins for the owner. This option is moderately profitable, but locations, i.e. size, may influence the demand for this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "840. B2W. This is a new business idea in the Philippines, but business has been started in a very small scale. The business itself can be sold at minimal costs if the customers are willing to invest.\n",
      "\n",
      "841. Gas Station. This business does not necessarily need a store as in option three, but it can make a lot of money with its high profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "842. Funeral Home/Funeral Center. In this business one could do as low as $1000 and get started. The profit margins on the cost of cremation are high, so the business would be fairly profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "843. Computer Repair business. This business can also be small-time or medium-time, but these are the only options that are feasible. An entrepreneur could operate this business with small investments and make millions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "844. Car Care and Parking lot. One can take these two businesses and combine them into one, making it more money. This is very profitable if the customer pays for the services they buy. Customers do not know the difference, because it does not affect the profits of the first business.\n",
      "\n",
      "845. Internet Service. One could set up an internet service for as low as $3000, or as high as $25000, depending on size and area. This option can be extremely lucrative because there is no cost of having to maintain the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "846. Towing and Biking Services, such as towing, bike repair and bike rentals. These businesses would be very profitable, even in snow storms where one would not know where the roads are. They can rent to anyone at the rate of $25 a month, making them very profitable ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "847. Beauty Salon\n",
      "\n",
      "848. Painting and Drywall. This business would work well at a location that requires many people to service, with only six people to service the job, or even less. A $1000-$2000 start up cost is reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "849. House Cleaning services. We offer you some services for as low as $2000. This business is quite profitable, but only if most people want to pay for professional cleaning services. It does not need a shop, and we don't have the staff to handle the day-to-day operation of a store.\n",
      "\n",
      "850. Pizza Store. This option is for a person who feels good about the money they may receive, and so goes to a pizzeria and orders for delivery. This option is more profitable in a certain city, where all they have to do is deliver and pick up from the pizza shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "851. Towing Service. You may want to consider starting a towing business and renting the necessary vehicles. This business is fairly costly, but very profitable in some locations. It helps if the location is relatively small.\n",
      "\n",
      "852. Automobile Repair Shop and Locksmith. One can set up an auto repair shop and locksmith shop for as low as $10,000, taking the total upto about $20,000 to start up and to operate smoothly. This is financially very profitable because of high demand.\n",

      "\n",
      "854. Bar-Liquor Store. One can acquire a bar-lounger and set it up to be a profitable business to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "855. Restaurant. Restaurants do not require much capital investment, because they can get loans in a year if needed. They are also very profitable and they pay quite well on weekends, or night time. Another advantage is no need to build a big store.\n",
      "\n",
      "856. Barbership. This business would cost more money, as a barber shop is not affordable for the low income person. However is the opportunity to cut hair for small business owners and those who are not ready to take a drastic cut from regular income as a single parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "857. Real Estate. Although this is quite expensive, there is huge demand for low income housing, especially in the more rural areas of town. If one starts up a real estate business, it would need some capital investment and a down payment, which usually comes with a good rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "858. Housecleaning. Most often these businesses are not profitable, unless you have a location. Even if you have a location, they often cost more to run than they sell, unless you take a lot of care. Housecleaning is one of the largest and least profitable options.\n",
      "\n",
      "859. Dry cleaning. One could buy a nice clean dry cleaning room (or if you can afford, rent one of them) and start your own dry cleaning business. For as low as $4000, one could get this started.\n",
      "\n",
      "860. Ice cream parlor. One can purchase an ice cream parlor for as low as $2000. The parlor would be able to have up to two flavors of ice cream made. However, these ice cream parlors, especially the popular ones, usually take longer to get established and profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "861. Cleaning service. Cleaning service is also a viable option, as low as $5000. An investment of $15000 will get one started.\n",
      "\n",
      "862. Internet Marketing\n",
      "\n",
      "863. T-Mobile wireless services. This type of business is still viable, and one could set up the company in the same location with the intention of reselling the equipment. T-Mobile would give credit card number to the customer in the process. One could put $1000s into the account along with a note expressing his/her intention of resale. This is still a profitable business to be in in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "864. Pet Salon. One could also consider an animal grooming business for as low as $6000 (with a little research of the competition), so one could have a great start off the gate. The small size of the business does not necessarily make it difficult, in fact it can help, but the owner will need to be very careful so they don't waste too much time. This is one of the best business ideas that you could consider if you plan to start up your own store.\n",
      "\n",
      "865. Business Consulting. The lowest amount to provide an honest estimate is $2000, and one could set up a business that runs in profit margins of 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "866. Pizza Hut. The same as above, with a price tag around $12000, but this could be very profitable if located in a major metropolitan area.\n",
      "\n",
      "867. Small Auto Repair Shop. One could get a small auto shop for as low as $1800, taking the total to $4200. This is a profitable as well as affordable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "868. Hairdresser services. Again, one buys this service in a store. But again this is not the lowest cost option. The store could set it out of the back and in that way keep the rent lower, but the amount would be more than the store could afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "869. Hair dressing. One could set their hair dressing business up for as low as $2000, excluding rent, to start up. Hair dressing for women is very profitable, but the same would not be true for men, considering the high cost of hair dye, since men only need a few strands to be colored without it looking completely different and unattractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "870. Computer Repair Shop. This is yet another business that is quite profitable during the summer months but requires a lot of money during the late winter months. One could buy the equipment and rent the necessary space. This can be done either one-on-one or with a group. If rented one-on-one one could rent one-room flat at about $150 per day per month. Renting with a group would only incur a small amount of extra money, so it might be good for a\n",
      "\n",
      "871. Lumberyard. For as low as $1500, one can be able to get all the necessary equipment, start a brick and mortar or online store. Lumber is also an extremely profitable business to be in.\n",
      "\n",
      "872. Bar & Billiards. One can start a bar & billiards establishment for as low as $1800 to $2500 in the first year. After that, the income goes up quite a lot because the cost of labor increases exponentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "873. Pizza and Sub-s. This business does not need a store at all as all it requires is a cash register, which can be purchased relatively easily. The costs of a location, the rent for the store and supplies are low, with one taking the total up to about $10,000 to start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "874. Jeweler. Many people buy jewelry through auction houses, but due to high interest rates, the cost of purchasing jewelry is much higher than it would be if one had to go through the process of a traditional loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "875. Laundry Service. This idea is very viable for small business owners that cannot afford a store or need something that is more affordable. This option can be affordable and work for multiple types of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "876. Construction Companies. One could setup a construction company for as low as $5000 and then start it up. This option would become more profitable as the business expands. The same amount of money could buy a used car and then pay for the first few months to get the business going. A very low start-up cost also makes it more feasible for a small business, but a higher cost could still be possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "877. Pizza and Pies. The most profitable business idea is this one. This starts at $8000 and could take to more than $10,000. It requires a little more than the other businesses, which can be financed on a short-term or long-term loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "878. Lawn Mowers and Garden Trimmer. The first choice for an affordable start up, yet profitable, would be to start a lawn mower shop, which is a rather popular and profitable business in United states. One who is interested in starting a lawn mower business would need to do a careful study as to how many miles one would have to travel daily and the price one could charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "879. Auto repair shop for small vehicles. This is a lucrative option, as it does not require a substantial amount of capital investment. For as low as $10,000, one can get the same equipment and start their business. The equipment is used on all the small vehicles available.\n",
      "\n",
      "880. Businesses that sell books. One could start a bookstore for as low as $1500 taking the total up to almost $5000 to operate and then make $4000 profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "881. Electric/Generator Repair/Sale. A small business that may need some supplies may require an electric repair service $1000. The cost of service is high, but you could be competitive as there is a supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "882. Car Wash. A car wash can be a profitable business with very little capital, as there is demand for the services offered. An initial investment of $1000 would suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "883. Barbershop. Getting a regular barber is not necessary. Barbershops do great in neighborhoods where bars are not. They would not get too many patrons. There are plenty of barber shops around the world, but they don't have that large of a scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "884. A business that creates products in need of cleaning, repairing, custom design is also an option. For as low as $3000, one could have a business in which one may even make $100 in a day. The low start up costs make this option profitable and profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "885. Car Wash. This business has the best profit margins. One could start a car wash on as low as $1000 and pay rent of up to $500 or rent of $10,000 to cover all utilities and a percentage of the profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "886. Music Studio, Karaoke, Dance Studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "887. Pet Shop. Even though this business is not very profitable, it can be a good investment opportunity. A minimum of $500 will get you started. However, this is only if you plan to stay in the area. This could quickly turn out to be one of the more profitable business ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "888. Funeral Home. The highest potential is for this business. The lowest costs are the most profitable. One can find a low cost building near the location, or purchase one and simply rent it out. Funeral homes cost about $6.000 and up.\n",
      "\n",
      "889. Auto repairs. For about $28000 to start a business of fixing up cars, one could open shop. At this point, it is better to open a car dealership, but to have the income and work less would be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "890. Internet Cafe. The first step is to make a website, which is not expensive to do. The $5000 will get you a new server and domain, and up to $6100 will get you a new web hosting account. It is worth noting you can make a website in a week, and after that, the website is available 24 hours a day!\n",
      "\n",
      "891. Pet Care. One could purchase a pet cleaning service for $1000 and start this business for $6000. This works great in a busy area.\n",
      "\n",
      "892. Music Lessons. A school would need the school room, which could be used as a music lesson space for students. This business could be set up for as low as $1500, which would give an acceptable start up, but with low profit margin and very little space to spare.\n",
      "\n",
      "893. Food Truck. One can obtain a food bus for about $2000, take it out of the ice cream truck and set up the food truck as a stand alone company. It can be extremely profitable, especially during summer months. It is also possible to start a food truck during winter months to provide meals for folks who are without power or any other means of food supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "894. Photography Studio. This business does not necessarily need a store, which saves space and money. If one can purchase a very good camera and use it for $8000, the start up cost for this business would be significantly low.\n",
      "\n",
      "895. Small manufacturing machine business: this is another business for which a low start up cost makes it feasible. For as low as $12000, you can invest in a new machine, pay your rent, pay your employees, and make money.\n",
      "\n",
      "896. Construction business. This business is probably not going to be profitable in any case because not many will be interested in building homes there. However, there are various options.\n",
      "\n",
      "897. Dry Cleaning Shop. This option can be as low as $3000. One can start with only all the equipment that he or she needs. This option is very profitable because it requires little startup costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "898. Golf Course Rentals. Many courses are owned by the state through the Department of Revenue. They are public golf courses of about 12-600 miles in length. They pay taxes on the fees to the state in order to maintain all the golf courses. On top of that, you would pay taxes on the cost of the materials that you use. This business would not need to buy land. They would just be renting a golf course. This option is moderately profitable on a long-term basis, but\n",
      "\n",
      "899. Computer and Software repair shop. This is the same as computer repair, except that it is for an industry that could potentially be larger than computer repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "900. Office Equipment. One could purchase computer office furniture such as printers and desks for as low as $1000 and get ready to open as soon as possible. This is not a profitable option, but can be a profitable one where the right location is found.\n",
      "\n",
      "901. Hair and Nail Salon. This could be an idea for an affordable small business. One may only need a hair and nail salon for as low as $2000. This is a profitable business if a high demand exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "902. Floral Shop. One could build a shop for as low as $1000, and start growing this business during summer season. But once the season is over, it could have very slow sales, if any.\n",
      "\n",
      "903. Pet Sitting: This business will also need a store, and it can be a profitable business. It is difficult to estimate the amount for each pet sitter business that is a low risk, high reward business.\n",
      "\n",
      "904. Dental Care. The low interest rate makes this business profitable to start up. It is a good option for someone with a dental emergency, or if the business is too close to the dentist's office and the waiting time is more than a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "905. Housecleaning. This option is available to anybody with a yard. For as small as $1000, one can set up a cleaning service. The low start-up cost makes it an affordable option for almost every person interested in a cleaner.\n",
      "\n",
      "906. Office Rentals. Office rentals usually cost around $8000 and should come out to be about $12000 in total. Of course, the space needs to meet the business' standards. The average size of the space for office rent should be around 9' x 14' and above.\n",
      "\n",
      "907. Pet Care Center. This is an idea that is also fairly profitable. Pets can spend a considerable amount of their time in a room, so these small businesses are very feasible to get the start up costs down.\n",
      "\n",
      "908. Personal grooming/beauty services. These businesses are moderately profitable depending on location and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "909. Online Bookshop. One could set up an online shop for as low as $2500 and get it up and running. A start up cost of $250,000 would be necessary to start this business, but one would be able to make decent money in this way. The money saved in rent, equipment, etc. will enable one to get into more business.\n",
      "\n",
      "910. Automobile Rentals. One could rent cars for $400 a month. After running the business for two months and earning $200, one would be able to rent another car for $1500. Then one could continue accumulating money. By the end of two months of this business operation, one could make $1200 without incurring any debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "911. Gasoline service station. This is probably the best option. For as little as $1000, one can get everything that one will need, which usually include gas, fuel, and other maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "912. Restaurant. One could operate a restaurant for about $17000, excluding rent, while still keeping your family fed and able to stay alive. It would take years of consistent income to make this a profitable option, but it might be a wonderful and amazing life experience. You should also be flexible on your spending habits and decide for yourself how much you would like to be able to live on as your income.\n",
      "\n",
      "913. Barber Shop. To start these up, one would need to purchase the appropriate tools, which can usually be found in a garage sale. One could start with as little as $1000 with as little as $1500 going to more profitable locations. Barber shops are also a profitable choice because people want to take a nice cut of the profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "914. Real estate investment. This option requires that one be in a low-income area. If one has enough money to fund this venture, one can get a loan to get started. This is a low-maintenance option, and a good opportunity to invest in the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "915. A pizza place. For as low as $2000, to start one could rent enough space for a small pizzeria. It may not be financially viable to run a large business, but the low start-up cost makes it a viable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "916. Cleaning Services. One can take a business idea from another, but one can choose a unique idea based on location. One can start out by taking in a friend or two and have them come back later with a location idea. Once one has a location idea, one can start by looking for an available office building for a space rental.\n",
      "\n",
      "917. Grocery store. Any grocery store business has to take cost into consideration, but a lot of times this type of business can not make as much profit as other business could. However, as profit margins are low, a lot of profits are made.\n",
      "\n",
      "918. Business card printing. This one also is possible to set up an online business, which works for some people, but printing business cards is an option.\n",
      "\n",
      "919. Construction and Renovation. This option is moderate to very profitable. For as low as a low as $5000, one can take possession of the land, get started with all the necessary equipment, and construct or renovate a small building. There is a wide range of these businesses depending on location, land value, and quality of building.\n",
      "\n",
      "920. Car Wash. An ice cream truck can usually afford $2000 on start up cost. One needs to provide the car wash service in addition to the ice cream truck service. However, the cost to operate car wash on their own is usually $500-$1000 per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "921. Cleaner's. I've seen three different business plans for this. One could have a store and charge the clients for their rent, taxes, supplies, etc, plus any of their services, etc. The rental fees could total up to $5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "922. Personal Care product manufacturer. One could set up a personal care product company with a small manufacturing unit at very low cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "923. Airplane repairing. One can easily get the required parts for less than $1,250 to start his business.\n",
      "\n",
      "924. Barber shop. This business does not necessarily need a store, which saves money. One could set up an barber shop for as low as $3500. This may very profitable, although demands will be on the basis of location and the number of people trying to get a haircut. If one is not in the city, an all service barbershop is probably not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "925. Pizza Shops. Start a pizza shop for as low as $2500, taking into consideration cost of hiring employees, equipment, and rent, you could expand the business to get more profits into your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "926. Hair Salon. One could open a salon for as low as $3000 and could have a good start up and have the equipment. These are not too profitable, but the low start up costs make it a lucrative option. There are several benefits to this business, including high customer traffic, repeat customers, a nice clean salon, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "927. Food Delivery. This business is also not as profitable as you think it can be. Starting with as little as $5000 and taking the total to around $15000 to start up, one can make a decent return on investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "928. Pizza delivery service. The main reason you need the money for this business is because you want to be able to earn an income. This is something that even though is not the most profitable, can still be attractive enough for the person who is qualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "929. Pizza restaurant. This is one of the cheapest and fastest businesses to start up. One can start this business for as low as $1500 and get it up in no time.\n",
      "\n",
      "930. Car-Shopping Shop. There are many different businesses that could be started for as low as $2000. There are many car- and vehicle-shops that offer low prices, and also offer good service and customer service. There is no need for inventory, and no need to stock up on groceries or other products.\n",
      "\n",
      "931. Web Design. One could start a web design business for as low as $700 per month. This business requires little to no startup costs, and can earn good profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "932. Hair Stylist. Once again for $3000, one can get their hair done. This option is moderately profitable also, but there is much higher demand than the other option.\n",
      "\n",
      "933. Pizza. At the lower end of the spectrum, getting a pizza shop would cost around $300-$500/month. The initial purchase would be around $3000-$5000. After a few months, the rental expenses would drop dramatically. The cost is quite low to start up because they are a low investment for a high profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "934. Hairdresser. This business only needs one room and one person. The only thing one needs is a table and chair, an electric curling iron, and an oven. The table and chair as well as electric curling iron does not cost much. The only thing they need is a table and chair. The start up costs, excluding rent, ranges between $1200-1500. This business is highly profitable, but with a start up cost of $1500, this business would have a small loss\n",
      "\n",
      "935. Hair Salon. One can open a hair salon this way for as low as $1500. The biggest draw to this is that salon is a business that is very safe and has little competition out there. The initial equipment can also be purchased for as low as $1200.\n",
      "\n",
      "936. Bookstore. This is probably the first option that comes to mind when one thinks of business ideas; but a book business alone is just not as profitable as many other small business options. If one is willing to incur certain debts and can have the money to pay those debt off, one can get started off with books alone. While books would not be very successful, one could get a modestly large profit margin and a great profit margin as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "937. A health spa. This business is not too profitable, but can be profitable using an existing location. One can hire in a qualified doctor, a licensed beautician, a manager, a nurse and of course a staff. The total amount of money is a combination of the start up costs and the rent. The rent is just for the space, the start up costs would be the purchase of the equipment, and maintenance as well. Overall this business is more profitable than the others, which makes it a\n",
      "\n",
      "938. Dry Cleaning. One could start up a business like dry cleaning, only for as low as $2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "939. Dry Cleaning Services. This business has a very low profit margin, but is feasible. For as low as $2000, the owner can rent the space from a cleaning company for $1000. In this scenario, the overall profit margin would not be as high as if the owner owned the space or paid for the equipment rental. However, the fact that the space is rented saves a lot of money if the rent is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "940. Internet Service Provider. This would be a relatively low profit option, even with a store. This is dependent on current and future internet services. For example, one service provider may now have an agreement with two hundred customers on one service, providing them with free wireless internet. If another service provider has agreed to supply internet service for more customers, there may be revenue potential by selling service. This is not usually a high profit option from a loan, but is worth looking into.\n",
      "\n",
      "941. Dry Cleaning Services. This business involves renting a booth for drying the clothes. One can rent this booths from $3000 but needs higher overhead such as rent and equipment. These expenses are quite cheap compared to the expenses required for a commercial establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "942. Real Estate. One could build up a real estate business and rent out their space or build an apartment or house. One could either invest and own the apartment or could buy it and rent out. Some are in the process of purchasing houses to renovate and convert into apartments, and are currently running low on cash flow because of mortgage payments. This was not mentioned in the first list in this post, it is just a way to explain it in a few comments. Some do own houses and use it\n",
      "\n",
      "943. Home Baking. One could set up a business of baking and selling cupcakes and homemade cakes. These are lucrative and have high profit margins, but would cost a little more if one cannot get loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "944. Dog grooming. One could choose to start this business for as low as $300 or $400. This starts to be quite lucrative. An average of about $4200 is needed to get the full business going. This business might make a profit in the summer time, but only about 50 percent in the winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "945. Restaurant. One could set up a restaurant business for as low as $2000 and get going. This is moderately profitable. As with the cleaning and care services, demand depends on location.\n",
      "\n",
      "946. Concrete Shop. This business is not for the faint of heart as concrete is a very heavy project. It takes very little money, but the business is not going to be able to support the owner's family. The owner will have to use his or her own resources but should be able to use someone else's resources for this project. Concrete shop is also slightly more risky as you may get into a dispute with a customer who doesn't like your price, however at $6000 the risk is\n",
      "\n",
      "947. Dental office. One could lease an office space for $1500 a month, or have one person rent it instead. These costs are low, but they are also not profitable as the lease might not be renewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "948. Grocery Store. In any location one could choose to sell groceries like rice, beans, beans, beef, and cheese, which can make a good business to boot. Prices are low, and the profit margin is good which is why most entrepreneurs choose to set up this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "949. Dog Food. This does not require a store. One can buy the necessary materials that one needs or can also find suppliers that sell the products.\n",
      "\n",
      "950. Lawn Care Shop. This business is not too profitable for the starting down low cost of $3100, but it does not need too much space, so it is feasible. However, the overhead is not high, so a loan would not be feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "951. Laundry Service. The owner of the laundry does very little work. The low start up costs make this a financially lucrative venture, especially if the laundry has sufficient customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "952. Personal Care Services. If one can get an accurate estimate for an affordable office space, then one can start a personal care services business that would only need $500 a month to start off. This business will provide good enough returns for the business expenses and have decent growth in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "953. Home Decoration Shops. This option involves a huge investment of time and money, but can be very profitable. However, you also have to bear the loss of profit when the weather changes and you lose the customers. This option costs around half the amount as selling the furniture. Again, this option will not be profitable even if you make it for a very long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "954. Video Game Store. Buying a game store does not guarantee the success of the video game business, but it does save money on rent. It is possible to purchase a video game store costing no more than $3000.\n",
      "\n",
      "955. Jewelry shop. To start up with $7500 will require a store and an office space, costing around $1000. A start up in a strip mall can be much more profitable and less costly than renting a store space in an office building or shopping center.\n",
      "\n",
      "956. Dental Office. This is an additional product that will need to be offered in addition to dental. For this, one can acquire a dental chair, office space, and an overhead door from a dental office or hospital, and then rent space in a dental office or hospital. This does not have to have a store, just an office as an on going business. This option is not too profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "957. Dog grooming. The owners usually charge $100 for an initial consultation and $100/hour for a dog grooming service. At this rate, it’d take about 15 years to make $20,000 and if it’s taken into consideration that most dogs need a lot more care and grooming, it’s more likely to fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "958. Cleaning and Care services. Another option and a nice profit is hiring a cleaning lady. As of today, they only charge $6 per hour on average. It could be higher depending upon the individual. If one could get into a cleaning lady business, there is no reason why the owner should be paying for the services of the cleaning lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "959. Real Estate Management. This business makes money during the year, but is not that profitable during the winter. It has better profit margins during summer and fall since demand is high. This business requires more capital to start and would cost more to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "960. Music School. Getting a music school does not require much capital. Inexpensive instruments can be bought with $5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "961. Dry Cleaning. This business can range from $2000 and up for a small service shop, to over $20,000 for a full service shop. This option would be very profitable with a large clientele because customers would know the business well, making referrals more possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "962. Customized clothing. One can choose from a number of custom made outfits for as low as $2000 to $5000. These are very profitable if one has the required skills. (If not, one could hire a tailor.)\n",
      "\n",
      "963. Home improvement. Start your home improvement business very simply. For as low as $2000 per year, you could start up a business that employs your entire family. Your business is based on your skill set and how you would use your customers help to make money.\n",
      "\n",
      "964. Automobile Repair. One could purchase an already running car repair shop for half the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "965. Pet Store. One can start this business with as little as $2500. This is very lucrative, and will be an excellent business.\n",
      "\n",
      "966. Jewelry Store. One could be a jeweler by renting out their shop for not more than 200 dollars per month. This option may only be profitable in certain locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "967. A Beauty Salon. This is another quite profitable option. With $2000 to start up, one does not need a substantial investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "968. Restaurant. One could open a restaurant that would serve reasonable meals, cost about $10000 to $20000, depending on size. A more lucrative option is to open a food cart business.\n",
      "\n",
      "969. Bar-B-Que. There are small bar-b-q joints everywhere. There could be as many as 15 in New York for only $2500 each. However, if one purchases this business in the area for $5500 each, the business could get a bit bigger. If one is lucky, they can get some of the needed supplies all on their own for $5000 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "970. Dry Cleaning Services. For $20,000 one can set up a clothing and dry cleaning shop. These are extremely profitable in busy times.\n",
      "\n",
      "971. Hair Cutting Business. With as low as a potential start up cost of $400, this is another profitable business to start up. However, for the same start up amount, one could open up a barber shop which generates a very respectable profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "972. Golf and Golf Shop. If one wanted to start their golf store, they just get as much equipment as needed for the golf center and set up shop for a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "973. Housekeeping services. This business does not necessarily needs a store, but it does need a set up. For example, one could rent a location in a suburb for under $1000. It would require some set up, but the monthly cost would be less than $500.\n",
      "\n",
      "974. Video Game Console Rentals. These are fairly low profitability, but do make a living for those who will work as a game store.\n",
      "\n",
      "975. A Pizza and Sub Shop. The start up can be as low as $2000, for example, and still make about $20,000 per year, which is a high profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "976. Car Buying and Selling. One could sell used cars for as low as $3000 to start their business. This option would have a low profit margin since car sales require little capital expenditure and are not as likely to go through during the winter months. This option is quite profitable, but there are other types of businesses that would require even higher starting capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "977. Automotive business/Car Dealership. This can start up for as low as $7000, and can run full operations without a permanent shop. One would probably need to look at this carefully to find the right location.\n",
      "\n",
      "978. Computer Repair and Services. You only need about $2000 to get started. To maximize profit, one could look for new customers rather than re-using an existing customer. There are few businesses that could survive on computer repairs every day, but as low as $3000, this is quite profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "979. Pet Sitting Services. The business works best when there is a lot of demand for pets from people in need to help with their care and cleaning. To get a solid start up, an area with many people who need a pet sitter like to go with this business. However, one would need to get their business started for at least $2000 if an area of low demand is desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "980. Convenience Store. One could set up a convenience store for about $100,000, taking up about two-thirds of the initial cost. This business requires a truck, but does not need to get customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "981. Bakery. This idea is fairly good. The bakery can be established as a business for very little money, but with very low profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "982. Barbers Shop. One could operate a barber shop for about $8000-10000. There are usually little to no profit margins with barber shops, making them cost prohibitive in the long term. This option is moderately profitable, and provides plenty of opportunity for business expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "983. T-shirt and Men's Outfits. Men's apparel stores can be started from $6000, including rent. These shops are quite profitable, and this business has a moderate profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "984. Car Wash. One can get an ice cream truck, woodworking shop, and cleaning and care services to create a car washing service. This is moderately profitable with a high demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "985. A Hair Salon. In order to stay productive, a salon needs a clean, well organized and well-maintained place. One can start this business for about $2000, which is a low budget, but it would keep clients and is a profitable idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "986. Music and Performing Arts/Concerts. One can sell one’s services for a lower-cost service business option, even for less than $10/ hr. The only disadvantage is that the business usually is not profitable in the long run. This option is moderately profitable, especially in times of peak demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "987. Pizza Factory. The biggest and most profitable business out of the 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "988. Hair Salon Business. This is not a profitable option, but is also not expensive. The only cost is hair cut, shampoo and conditioner. The only thing you need is a basic set up and maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "989. Car Wash, or Washing Up. One could do this for $2000, including the required space. This option is quite profitable, but the cost of running and managing the business comes in to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "990. Music Company. Again, this option does not need a store. Start up with $7000 and get the equipment up, plus the start-up costs to make it functional within a month. This business is moderately profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "991. Restaurant. It is not profitable to open one in a location where there already are multiple restaurants. For $2000-$3000, one can invest into it and see how it works or just stick to their budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "992. Dry Cleaning Service. This is an option that may pay for the initial investment of equipment, but the actual cleaning and pressing would have to be done at the client's location. The profit is low, but the location is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "993. Carpentry Shop. For as low as $4000, one can set up this business. This small shop is moderately profitable, especially since the start up costs are low.\n",
      "\n",
      "994. Barber shop. One can get an investment of about $3000 or less and start a barber shop. Barber shops for men can be very profitable, but for women, they are not as profitable, but still low in cost of goods for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "995. Jewelry and costume shop. One could purchase a simple jewelry and costume store for as low as $5000. This is a decent choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "996. Grocery and Home Shopping. One can start his or her own grocery and home shopping business with a low starting cost. In many states, these services are not too expensive and do not require an additional location.\n",
      "\n",
      "997. Small Retail. If one starts this business with $2000, or less, then it is a viable option. If one starts this business with $12000, then this business is not viable due to a very competitive market.\n",
      "\n",
      "998. Photography. This is a good option for almost any person who has the artistic talent. This business does not need too much money to start it up because it can earn a bit much money during the day, but after a certain point it does not earn much.\n",
      "\n",
      "999. Custom Fabric. For as low as $2000, one might consider starting up this business. You do not have to own any land for this to work, and this can be located in your spare time in order to reduce work pressure in your regular schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "1000. Internet Store. One could take a low cost laptop computer and get it up and running. The only thing that I would not like is a store, but as low as $1000, one can get the internet.\n",

      "1. Consider giving equity stakes to its top bosses in case it defaults. If it fails, the creditors would receive the funds with the top brass getting the lion’s share.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Go cash strapped. It is best not to attempt to find out if a cash crisis is imminent. Many companies are in cash strapped mode which only further reduces their credit risks. They need other options, or to go cash strapped even if there are problems and a cash crisis becomes imminent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sell assets. Assets would include inventory and machinery. Selling assets could give the company enough resources to buy new products without selling their current inventory. The company can then take on a new line of products.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Cut office expenses. Reduce your office space to meet the needs of your business. You can do this either by buying out the current office space or by moving to a smaller office.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Seek an angel investor. An angel investor can be a great help. If the amount of capital borrowed is not too much, his contributions might pay for your payroll, marketing operations, rent, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Get out of tax debt. Many companies find tax credits attractive, especially given the current economic recession. As they struggle to bring in new clients to take their place, some might not be able to pay their taxes. The cash flow then doesn't cover those debts. The decision could be either to settle the tax debts and receive the tax credits, or to take the loss and get out of tax debt quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Cut salary and vacation benefits. These may seem like nice offers, but are really nothing more than promises. So it makes sense to take them out on a temporary basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Go into debt. Debt is a necessary evil to a company’s survival. If the company wants to keep operating for some period, it has to borrow until the debt is paid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Invest in inventory. Inventory could be bought on credit, in order to maintain supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Buy-out all inventory. The company might be able to buy up all its inventory at a bargain value, thus saving money while it can ride out the recession and return to profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Keep the company up-to-date with technology. This will help the company stay relevant in the business world while providing its customers with an improved experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Short Term Debt Retirement. A key reason for the financial crisis is that our debt-to-equity ratio has never been lower. At some point, there may be little choice but to sell the company’s debt, but that should be considered after a thorough analysis of the total debt structure of the company and the company’s income statement. After that, the company could ask the lenders for forgiveness of a large portion of the debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Redirect the company’s cash flow. After reviewing its current expenses it would be ideal to see if the company can find a way to save at least 10% of the revenues it receives. The company may also have to make some changes to how it conducts its business. This could make it profitable, but will also significantly lower its revenues and bring in much more costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Rethink the product marketing strategy by using less expensive channels or by focusing on its core clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Cut off suppliers. The company could cut off some suppliers and also cut back on production, with these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Sell assets. In the event that the company is in serious financial difficulties, the owner could consider selling assets which can be used for liquidity purposes, which may also lower the company's tax obligation on its shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Stop using a contractor or agency service. If a company has to find an existing expert, it may be more cost effective to take the risk on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Get rid of overhead expenses such as office supplies and furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Change the name. Companies which have become obsolete or which have gone bankrupt will have a difficult time finding a buyer. By changing the name of the company, the company’s identity would be kept clear, at least while it floats on its current clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. Hire temporary foreign workers in order to decrease the number of employees to be laid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Increase advertising costs. A company can increase its advertising costs by 1-2 times if it reduces marketing costs and hires more marketing team members.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. Increase wages. This can be done by increasing wages, including salaries, overtime, or benefits to keep up with inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. Hire an outside firm for the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. Change business strategy so that the company is not just a marketing organization. A business plan is a good way to look at the present opportunities and look at ways to go forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Cut the company’s operating expenses. Lowering expenses are good, but you need to evaluate how you can do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. Lay off a few more employees than planned. If the management needs to lay-off employees in the near future, the reasons should be listed in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "27. Improve its credit rating. This is essential for businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "28. Close branches. The company should consider closing branches that are no longer profitable and no longer generate new client revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "29. Cut all operational costs. The company could look to scale back on non-core operations like HR, finance etc., cutting salaries, and even the cost of supplies will help keep it afloat and keep the costs under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "30. Start offering products on ebay. The company may need to raise funds for this from equity investors or find a more reputable market.\n",
      "\n",
      "31. Sell some assets. If the company’s assets are too bulky or old to sell, the company management can sell the assets, pay the debt on the assets, and then use the difference to retire debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "32. Sell assets. The company could sell off certain assets, leaving those assets available for future use.\n",
      "\n",
      "33. Recruit from outside the company. If the company already has a staff, it can consider replacing some or all. This could prove to be beneficial as employees who are more efficient can be found, and it could help cut down on the expense of recruiting from within the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "34. Improve product quality. Another reason to cut non-essential business expenses could be to improve product quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "35. Sell assets. The company could sell some of its more expensive assets and then make up for the shortfall in cash flow by taking on more debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "36. Take a part time job. The company may have been losing money in business during these lean times. Taking part time jobs while also taking care of your family is a good option.\n",
      "\n",
      "37. Cut salaries. A reduction in salary will help reduce employees' expenses, and in turn help reduce the company's expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "38. Reduce company debt. The company is already taking a loan from another business partner, this could be reduced, and the reduced amount taken out through additional line of credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "39. Close offices. If the company has too many offices, the cost of office space can be more than the annual cost of the company. Also, the company might need to lease offices in another city since it will not have enough money to buy a new office in a different city.\n",
      "\n",
      "40. Take a tax write-off. The company can offset its tax liability by selling the goodwill and assets it holds while its core team were laid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "41. Change management structure. It is necessary for the company to streamline and centralize its management structure to make it efficient and better value for the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "42. Reduce staff. Employee reductions can help reduce expenses, but also harm brand building. On the other hand, reducing the number of staff may also help the company to raise its profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "43. Restructure or split into two companies. The company should consider getting a bankruptcy lawyer to help it get through the process if it needs to exit completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "44. Rework your business plan. It could take years before the company manages to turn it’s current marketing model into a lucrative business.\n",
      "\n",
      "45. Take out short-term loans from different sources. There is no one lender to take over all the bank loans, so company management should consider taking out loan from different sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "46. Don’t go public with the stock price. If it is still below the IPO price, it will be better to wait. It will cost a lot of money to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "47. Sell assets. One can imagine how much of the company’s assets can be sold off to reduce its liabilities and increase cash flow in the medium term. This step may require more extensive financial analysis than the next ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "48. Cut expenses. To avoid laying off employees, the company can consider simplifying its operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "49. Change its name. In some cases, when your company is in a precarious position, you could consider changing the name of the organization to a new name with a clean image.\n",
      "\n",
      "50. Outsource projects and functions to another company. Having another company handle the project or function can reduce administrative overhead and help companies keep costs lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "51. Sell off parts of the company. When the company is in better shape, it can sell off its parts as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "52. Start investing in employee benefits. A company could invest in such things as:\n",
      "\n",
      "53. Close a few stores or get rid of them. By closing retail or wholesale stores that the company is not using due to financial pressures will save the company money.\n",
      "\n",
      "54. Purchase equipment for the business (not that it would have any equipment, but you never know what company could need).\n",
      "\n",
      "55. Consolidate functions, possibly by merging. This would enable it to achieve several goals at once, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "56. Change it name. The company could get a new name and a new logo with a different color scheme which would give it a new “vibe”.\n",
      "\n",
      "57. Sell assets. By selling assets, the company can increase cash flow and get a high purchase price for those assets which would be easy to liquidate when it comes time to get paid the money back.\n",
      "\n",
      "58. Consider selling the company. The company has not run out of funds yet, so there is still the chance it could pay the outstanding invoices and still be healthy enough to survive.Q:\n",
      "\n",
      "59. Sell assets. If the money from selling off its assets could be put to better use, then it may not even be necessary to shut down operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "60. Reduce or replace inventory. The company can reduce inventory by selling some of the goods and taking out some of the credit for this inventory.On a Thursday afternoon, a dozen people who work at a restaurant in New York's Chelsea neighborhood say they became the unwitting victims of a mass cyber attack that the Department of Homeland Security has blamed on North Korea.\n",
      "\n",
      "61. Sell the company. By selling the company, the management will be able to reduce financial obligations and increase liquidity by selling its non-core business operations for the quick sum of the price tag of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "62. Sell assets - Assets include land, buildings, personal vehicles, etc. This is the cheapest route to take, as the cost of selling the assets directly is usually less than the net value of the sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "63. Sell off non-core operations. Non-core operations should be sold off as soon as possible while the company is still able to sustain operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "64. Lay off part time staff. You could send the part time employees home with full wages and benefits for a period of time while you hire new full time staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "65. Sell the company. The management could sell the company and the assets to a third party, and split the proceeds from the sale for the company. In this scenario, the company's liabilities are divided among the third party and the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "66. Cut back on expenses. This may include a lower marketing budget, reducing employees, or cutting back on training sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "67. Restructure its expenses. The company can restructure the existing contract with a new supplier or take alternate production if expenses are too high.\n",
      "\n",
      "68. Close an important factory. The company could sell or transfer its operations temporarily to an external vendor. In the case of an unsuccessful sale of operations, the company could use the capital to reduce its operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "69. Take another route. In the worst case, the company can start looking at exiting the industry altogether by selling the company to another company with a newer industry, technology or process.Q:\n",

      "70. Sell the company. This is my preferred option as it is the best way to take control of your own business affairs and become the sole owner! This would allow you to determine the future of your company which would not be restricted by the whims of the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "71. Increase revenues. The company should strive to increase revenues by 10%. There are certain steps that could help to increase its profits faster, such as a better website, better brochures, and better advertising campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "72. Sell/let the company. A final option for the company management is to consider selling the company to a company who does not want to deal with it and is willing to absorb the entire cost and the liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "73. Take care of debt. The company could try and negotiate an out of court resolution of some or all of its outstanding debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "74. Seek tax exemption. The company could declare itself as a trade or business under the country's tax laws. It would be treated much more favorably under tax law than a general manufacturer or small business, which in many countries have to pay much higher rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "75. Buy land and improve its physical condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "76. Get a raise. A company can use the raise for employee benefits such as a new cell phone plan or pension contributions and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "77. Refund taxes. The company can take the opportunity to defer taxes on its previous clients while providing tax-deferred treatment for future clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "78. Close down a business line.\n",
      "\n",
      "79. Redirect investments. This entails making changes in its investments portfolio so that it is not reliant on cash generated due to the company’s operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "80. Seek tax advice. Some companies can take advantage of the existing income tax laws for some short-term tax saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "81. Reduce staff. The company management could consider a 15-20% cut in the number of employees throughout the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "82. Purchase assets. The company management should consider acquiring assets whose value increase as revenues increase. This is a popular tactic, but there are drawbacks. Assets may be worth substantially more while the company is at full capacity while the assets that the company should purchase are in relatively good condition. Additionally, the company buying the assets may be forced to pay much more than the value of the assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "83. Cut employee benefits and/or cut benefits. It depends on the size of the company and the employees, but can be considered for small/medium companies or when employees receive a reduced wage package as a consequence of the company's declining financial structure, layoffs taking place or when there is an unexpected influx of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "84. Sell the company. In the event the company is sold to someone else, it could be liquidated to pay back creditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "85. Refinance bank loans. This is one option the company management can still consider despite the above. They could look at the long-term credit rating. If it is good, the company would look for a financial supporter to help keep the company afloat during this transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "86. Donate product to charity. The company will need to find a way to donate the remaining product to charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "87. Sell all assets. The company will have to face a big challenge to close it’s books: it’s been selling off assets. This will hurt its cash flow, and hence its cash reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "88. Retain a majority stake. Many businesses are losing their owners due to retirement, divorce, bankruptcy or health concerns for example and are left with only the shares held by the family and investors. A majority stake in the company can save the company and the owners a lot of time and money spent in getting a new owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "89. Cut staff. The company could reduce staff by 20-30%, keeping the core team and main operations personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "90. Sell assets. The company could sell land and other assets which has been paid in full for. This will increase the value of the assets at a cheaper price.\n",
      "\n",
      "91. Find out how much the business may owe and then decide how much to request the lender.\n",
      "\n",
      "92. Hire an accounting firm to review the financials. It’s also recommended to hire an outside accounting firm to do a complete re-evaluation of the financial reports, in case the previous accountants can’t answer or give the right answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "93. Consolidate business with a bigger company. This will keep the company competitive while cutting costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "94. Close its retail stores. It may not make any financial sense to liquidate its retail stores, but the company management may decide not to renew leases with the current retail partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "95. Close a department. After laying off employees and taking a loan, the company could close its finance department and restructure the company's internal accounting and human resources functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "96. Stop marketing campaigns which are no longer needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "97. Increase operating expenses (eg. wages). The company could request for an increase in wages and benefit packages, in order to reduce its operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "98. Look for an acquisition. The company could look to acquire another company and merge with it at this point. This merger would help reduce expenses and also improve its products or services.\n",
      "\n",
      "99. Cut off services. The company needs to reduce operating costs or turn away customers to save money. If a company runs a retail store or a grocery store, shutting down all the retail outlets will free cash to buy needed supplies, so customers will turn to another merchant. However, if a business only sells an expensive service, like an insurance or mortgage company, cutting down on the service and offering cheaper services will keep customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "100. Cut the salary of senior management. If it were a non-profit organization, it would be much healthier to reduce the salary of all high managerial salary earners, so that they could contribute more to the organization as volunteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "101. Take a cash loan for some time. This can be an option when the company is a small operation or has a small list of accounts receivables. If it has a good reputation and is on good terms with its creditors, the company managers could take a cash loan from one of several financial institutions. This will enable the company to operate for at least 6 months without any creditors demanding repayment of the loan. Some financial institutions charge a percentage of the outstanding amount, while others offer fixed fees. Since\n",
      "\n",
      "102. Increase the size of the operation. The company can increase the amount of the business, by opening new branches or hiring additional employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "103. Retire senior executives. The company may need to do a series of ‘cost reduction’ programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "104. Move it to a different space. It may be more profitable to move the company to a new facility that is cheaper to maintain. The company should do so if the new space is better equipped to accommodate the company’s new level of productivity needs, but the company should save money by keeping the initial space for as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "105. Reconsider sales strategy. If the company continues to depend on the traditional direct retail model, there is a chance that the company will get left behind in line with the changing demands. It is recommended to try the new market strategies from established brands or to try out new marketing channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "106. Sell businesses or assets. The company could sell its land, equipment or even a whole plant if its liabilities exceed its current assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "107. Restructure operations. The management should evaluate the current financial liabilities and explore if restructuring the company would be feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "108. Use the cash flow generated from sales of the current products to improve efficiency in your business. This will increase the money generated per customer and bring down the amount of cost needed per customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "109. Sell assets. Any assets left over from past purchases would help the company keep afloat until a more suitable time. Consider selling the main operations equipment if the company still possesses some assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "110. Layoff the CEO. This has been done in some companies but a CEO’s retirement is no longer taken lightly especially when it involves a company that is struggling to survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "111. Hire employees as contractors. This is often preferable as it allows for better management and monitoring of expenses and reduces the liability of the company towards third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "112. Cut expenses. The key would be the cost of all the other parts of the business. The company would incur more expenses to keep it running.\n",
      "\n",
      "113. Close the company. Some companies can also shut down their operation at the end of their term of 10-15 years. This practice is not uncommon.\n",
      "\n",
      "114. Review operations. Conduct a cost-cutting inspection of the company’s operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "115. Take out a line of credit. This will help the company to increase sales in the short term while reducing its overall risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "116. Consolidate to a bigger company. Consolidating itself to a bigger company that can handle the same clientele can be a sound and effective decision made by the company management. This will be a great solution to reduce the company’s operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "117. Layoff staff, especially those with long service contracts. It is common for those on long service contracts in the IT industry to be fired while most other segments of the economy fire junior staff for shorter periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "118. Sell the company. After all the above steps were taken, the company can sell its assets for a small profit (10 to 15% of the assets’ market value). However many companies prefer a merger with a much larger firm as it would allow them to operate at their full capacity, which means they would have to pay all its employees a higher wage and also provide benefits such as health insurance (for their employees).\n",
      "\n",
      "119. Pay back tax debt. A company can't run forever. Even if one of the primary reason for cutting costs was to cut costs, the government taxes should be paid off sooner than later.\n",
      "\n",
      "120. Consider increasing dividends or reducing management charges\n",
      "\n",
      "121. Sell its business. Although it is an asset, selling it is not possible without a fair amount of funds from selling some other assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "122. Consider selling its existing property. This might not be an easy decision, but is a good way to raise cash to pay for your ongoing expenses and can make sure you have enough working capital to survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "123. Review the company’s contracts and make cuts and/or renegotiate them. Contractual and non-contractual obligations could help the company to restructure and to cut costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "124. Increase sales. Increased sales would increase the company’s revenues which will reduce its expenses, but in the short-term the benefits do not outweigh the short-term cost of increased sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "125. Cut expenses by eliminating non-essential services. This is critical in any business, where a company needs to keep costs down as much as possible in order to keep itself afloat. This is true for any company, but especially true for those that have a large service or equipment business.\n",
      "\n",
      "126. Cut the company expenses related to the payroll. This could be done by reducing employee salaries, increasing the retirement age, and cutting expenses associated with the company's vehicles and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "127. Consider moving to a new location or relocate completely. The decision should be based on the pros and cons of different options available and then make decision with the help of financial experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "128. Use surplus capital to purchase items of value, such as inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "129. Seek alternative funding. The company management should seek alternate funding from various sources. If the business is not making the grade any longer, it’s better to sell outright the business to an investor rather than ask them for loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "130. Take out a personal loan. A personal loan provides a way for the company to borrow money on the same short-term basis without the financial hardship that a business loan could give, and at a very low interest rate.Criminal Minds (season 20)\n",
      "\n",
      "131. Reduce employee benefits. The company should consider asking its employees for voluntary retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "132. Cut back on expensive professional services. For instance, take a loan to pay off their outstanding medical bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "133. Increase advertising costs. Although the company would lose significant revenues during the down-times, it could charge more than average for advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "134. Sell the business assets. During the downturn, selling the assets could be difficult at first as the company may decide to pay a lump sum at a low price, sell assets or to close the operations for a certain period in exchange for a small amount of money. The company could sell the business premises and the stock certificates of the business on which the tax has accrued, to pay the outstanding tax in a tax-efficient manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "135. Close the business. A company could consider selling its operation, if it has a huge debt that cannot be rolled over, but it would then be in a much financially better position to refinance the debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "136. Sell its business. The company itself could be sold to private entrepreneurs or to a new owner-funder in exchange for a good rate of return. This could be achieved through an orderly exercise of the bankruptcy procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "137. Reduce staff by 20-30%. Having to lay off over 20 staff members does not have to be the end of the world though.\n",
      "\n",
      "138. Sell itself. Buy out the company or sell it to another entity in order to reduce costs and reduce debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "139. Reduce office space, furniture and equipment. The company’s office expenses are generally higher due to it running multiple business lines, so the company would need to cut down on its office space and office furniture and equipment to cut down on the overall expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "140. Sell assets or close businesses. The company, as an asset of the company, could be sold off in order to free up equity capital so that new investment can begin\n",
      "\n",
      "141. Reduce the overhead expenses. This could involve cutting non-core operations, such as research and development and human resources departments. If other resources are needed to sustain daily operations, then let them work on generating new cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "142. Eliminate the stock dividend. The company could implement a stock dividend, which would be a tax saving measure for the company even without an actual stock dividend payout.\n",
      "\n",
      "143. Sell some of the assets. Selling the assets can save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in the short-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "144. Pay employee retirement contributions. Even if the employees did not work in years, the company might want to pay the monthly contributions to a certain fund for its employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "145. Sell the company. The company could consider selling it to another group at a lower price, leaving the current stockholders in the process, or it could sell it to a new private equity firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "146. Increase the sales force. In an effort to keep up with a rapidly changing market, or because the company has decided to move to a new market, the new sales force could be increased to meet the new demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "147. Start selling products and services on the company website.\n",
      "\n",
      "148. Stop advertising on social media. As the company becomes a smaller entity the need for social media is less to keep the news of events as high as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "149. Offer incentives in exchange for client loyalty. When clients begin to notice the reduced work hours and reduced prices, they will start to lose interest, and the business could lose momentum. That's where an incentive such as a 25% reduction in salaries for every new customer gained can be an effective motivational tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "150. Raise capital in the bank. The bank would help the company in the short term as well as in the longer term.\n",
      "\n",
      "151. Re-evaluate the investment portfolio. There should be an evaluation of the company’s current investment portfolios to decide if it can afford to keep them, and if so to cut them down to the most profitable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "152. Close unprofitable businesses. If a company can demonstrate that there is a significant chance of it being profitable in the future, it could be the best way for it to avoid any potential risk of bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "153. Sell assets or take on a debt. Selling assets and taking on a greater debt would help the company reduce its financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "154. R&D expenditure. The company should carefully plan for its research and development programme so that the new products do not get a raw deal over any long-term investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "155. Move upmarket. If the cost of the first two options are too high the company could consider moving upmarket, where it can sell its products and services more effectively and at a higher price point. This option could be especially useful if the company is in a weak position because of poor customer relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "156. Reduce the corporate overhead. This is an idea that I have seen many companies consider. With reduced corporate overhead, the company would spend less on marketing services as the new business would be able to draw on it more regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "157. Sell real estate. Companies that have real estate or real estate assets in their balance sheet are usually unable to sell their properties off for several years, in the future. The value of the real estate will be eroded to some extent once the assets are sold. So, they don’t have to pay much in total, and at least they could save some cash to pay their bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "158. Seek government grant for working capital. A company in a tough economical situation would look for more and more government grants in order to maintain its operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "159. Create a contingency plan. The company could create a back-up plan for its main business, business development and production.\n",
      "\n",
      "160. Buy a foreign investment property. Due to its recent cash crunch, the company may be forced to look for a business investment, and could buy a foreign property which is either cheaper/cheaper to run, and would be more profitable per month than operating in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "161. Seek credit from banks. Many banks have agreed to extend credit on the condition that the company reduces its total debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "162. Create a product. Create a product around the problem and offer help to its customers. Offer a solution rather than simply providing solution. This is an easy way to increase sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "163. Consolidate its overhead costs. If the company is operating at a loss, it should close its operations and consolidate its management expenses. This can be done by putting it up for sale. The company can be listed on an exchange or on an internal bourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "164. Go into business with a partner. This will help the company stay in business while building the business over time and will allow it to grow with the help of a partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "165. Reduce payroll. The company’s management should consider reducing the number of employees at least temporarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "166. Go private.\n",
      "\n",
      "167. Create a new product. Some of the companies are already in the production phase for their product/service and are looking for a new niche and a new market.\n",
      "\n",
      "168. Close down the business branch in that country. If the firm does not have the finances to keep it on the local market while it waits for the loan funds, it might just close down the branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "169. Sell assets. This is a very risky option. If the company has a big enough client base, then perhaps a sale could be made. However, this is not necessarily the best course of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "170. Pay employees. The company could consider paying employees to reduce its expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "171. Consider reducing its stock or taking a stock buy-back. An equity buy-back program often gets investors on board with buybacks and, at the same time, keeps cash flow flowing in the short term.\n",
      "\n",
      "172. Sell off its non critical business units. If the company has a valuable but non-core asset tied up in the companies, this can be sold off to private investors and thus take the money out of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "173. Keep the company operating. If a major cash flow problem appears, the company could consider going to a cash-flow positive status temporarily. This could allow the company to cut its operating expenses further during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "174. Sell assets to reduce liabilities. The company could sell some assets to reduce liabilities by lowering bank borrowings. The sale could also be a way to reduce the business’s capital expenditure while increasing its revenues over the next 24 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "175. Make cuts in operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "176. Sell. The company can either sell non profitable assets (such as land, houses), or take the decision to shutter, and close the doors, on its operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "177. Seek for a buyout or IPO. This is the easiest thing for such a firm to do. If management feels that a buyout or IPO will be in the best interests of the company, then they can seek for such and raise capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "178. Layoff some employees. The company could lay off some people for a few days to save money, if its financial situation allows it. The laid off staffers could be trained to assist the staff in providing the necessary work to the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "179. Sell land. Using the land and buildings as collateral, the company could sell the land to a bank in exchange for a cash advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "180. Reduce its capital expenditure. This would involve reducing the company’s costs via reducing operating costs or even selling the company’s assets or using some of its cash flow to reduce the company’s liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "181. Cut maintenance costs. There may be certain projects that the company is unable to pass on to its suppliers due to a limited amount that can be procured. If the company has to pass on these projects to its suppliers, it could do it on cash-only basis and get certain discounts and reimbursements for part of the project cost. This way, the company would be able to continue its day-to-day operations with minimal financial damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "182. Convert the company to 100% employee-owned, an innovative idea that has been floating around since the 1980s. In a nutshell, the company can convert its current structures to employee-ownership, and the employees own the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "183. Consolidate your expenses. The company should reduce its expenses in the most efficient way. It can’t expect to grow if it doesn’t cut the expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "184. Reduce its overhead expenses. By doing so, it can reduce its sales and marketing costs and focus on cutting its costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "185. Give employees shares. Give employees a stake in the company and let them share the profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "186. Take bankruptcy. The company may need to sell assets if it finds itself in difficult circumstances. This should be done as soon as possible though, since the tax implications would be immense. To avoid this scenario, the company should always have sufficient cash reserves to cover its liabilities. Bankruptcy may also be the best option when the company has no other alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "187. Negotiate better terms with suppliers. By negotiating better terms, the company will reduce the expenses of the suppliers and save it some money as well. The new deal should be a long term agreement so the supplier can benefit from it over a period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "188. Review its credit policies. It should examine if it has any unfulfilled obligations with regards to credit and credit cards, loan accounts etc. It should consider whether it should continue to honor its card or loan. If it has any unfulfilled obligations it should consider whether to file bankruptcy or sell its assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "189. Give up on unprofitable services. It is easy to say don’t work on things related to unprofitable business. But in this world, most of our businesses face huge challenges everyday to grow, while we have more options to make it profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "190. Consider an infusion of cash from either an outside investment or a cash infusion from an external investor if it can take funds from multiple sources and can take advantage of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "191. Change business strategy. One of the possible areas for cutting costs is business strategy. A company that has already been losing money for a while can take one last shot at the business plan by trying to compete with new entrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "192. Reduce inventories. This may mean downsizing the inventory, reducing its stocks of consumer goods, and reducing the quality of the products.\n",
      "\n",
      "193. Offer better terms to potential clients. For example, increase the fees for customers, reduce commission percentage (and thus income), offer lower costs to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "194. Close down the company. It’s a risky move, especially if the company doesn’t have cash. But if the company has accumulated debts and no way of paying them, it could sell off everything that it can. The company could also close down its offices to prevent clients from inquiring about the situation of the company’s accounts or the status of its loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "195. Invest in new technologies. The company can use technologies such as online software to expand its clientele, increase online sales and reduce overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "196. Invest in capital assets. The company could invest in some additional machines, or increase the volume of some products in its supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "197. Sell assets. This will enable the company to maintain operations, and reduce the number of liabilities it has.\n",

      "198. Sell its assets. If it cannot sell its assets, it can try to borrow money from the bank and purchase them.\n",
      "\n",
      "199. Consider reducing staff at all levels in order to save costs. This is a good strategy. However, it is important to see how the other areas of the company could be affected first. For example: a department might be cut in order to reduce an important product or service.\n",
      "\n",
      "200. Look at buying back shares. Selling off shares would give the management the cash for some of their operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "201. Sell the company to a new management which has more financial and sales acumen.\n",
      "\n",
      "202. Close a low-profit customer. One of its main clients is in a low-profit environment and may not get business in the first place. If the company can offer something better, then it can attract new customers. If the customer is not sustainable and in a good financial situation, then the company can try to sell it to another business.\n",
      "\n",
      "203. Eliminate expenses. An elimination of unnecessary products or services will reduce inventory while the company floats.\n",
      "\n",
      "204. Reduce salaries. If the management is really cutthroat and wants to trim costs, then they should pay part of employees’ salaries with a business loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "205. Buy property. By now, the company has a very good understanding about the assets it holds, what type of ownership benefits it, and can it be converted easily. Therefore, it is quite likely that the company can convert its property into cash without too much difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "206. Reduce expenses on equipment. The company could be forced to spend more if it invests on current expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "207. Restructuring the company assets. The company could sell or off-load parts off its current equipment and/or invest its savings in new equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "208. Outsource some part of the tasks that are not profitable. The company could contract out some duties such as travel, training etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "209. Change management. The corporate culture has got to change. Managers need to step out of their own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "210. Reduce staff. Reduce staff by 20-30%. If the company has a large payroll, it may need one or two of the more experienced engineers to be laid off. These experienced individuals will become unemployed and the company might find it difficult to replace them immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "211. Buy more assets. If the company is already working on its next generation of laptops and other devices, then it could buy those at less than the cost of manufacturing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "212. Delay the purchase of new equipment. This would result in the delay of getting another vehicle and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "213. Cut staff to a quarter or less. If the company does not cut staff, it will be forced to lay them off and lay off new hires at the same time. For those people left, the cutbacks will not be temporary. They can expect a lay off at the end of the month as the company reduces its workforce to a quarter or less.\n",
      "\n",
      "214. Use part of company funds to pay back a mortgage. Using company funds to pay down debts and to pay mortgage, could put more cash back into the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "215. Cut non-essential employee cost. Once employees no longer have to do routine tasks, their overtime, benefits, and costs for personal items would be reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "216. Delay hiring new employees. Once the situation is serious enough to warrant a layoff, the company could get in a state of emergency, and delay hiring new employees to avoid having to pay additional salaries in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "217. Redesign the office premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "218. Get into a merger. The company could merge with another company with better financial management to create a stronger and more stable company.\n",
      "\n",
      "219. Invest in training. New employees may learn a lot during their first days on the job, a new strategy could pay them dividends after.\n",
      "\n",
      "220. Sell the company’s assets. If the company has enough assets to be sold, the shareholders will decide what to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      "221. Buy its own server. If you are struggling with inflexibility and lack of resources, using more of them will increase efficiency and allow your business to grow as an alternative to outsourcing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "222. Change name. It is not possible to do this immediately but as the company sinks, it would benefit from changing its name to avoid any adverse effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "223. Start making strategic alliances. The company could consider partnerships with other companies to form alliances that may help in the short term; if the alliances proved successful, they might add new clients who would bring in fresh revenue to the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "224. Consider taking an IPO. If a company needs to reduce costs and stay afloat, going public and taking on debt is an option which would provide liquidity and protect the company from bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "225. Cut costs where you can. Don’t hesitate to take a short-term lease of a store or rent a room in an expensive hotel. This will not only increase profits for a certain time, but will also help you save some money on the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "226. Change the name. Most entrepreneurs start with an idea and then come up with a name for it. If this name is too difficult to pronounce, it may be a good time to reconsider it or move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "227. Convert investments to cash in an attempt to buy assets of the company, by converting the cash holdings in the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "228. Sell assets. This might entail selling their assets or borrowing more money to finance more expansion to meet new client needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "229. Reduce overhead costs. If the company can't slash its overhead costs, it will have to consider laying off employees. This would also save the company cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "230. Cut back on the production process. Depending on the amount of cash flow from operations, the company could cut production and staff the company for the purpose of avoiding layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "231. Hire contractors. For many companies, hiring a temporary employee to do the work of regular employees can be expensive. But contractors can reduce costs immediately and help the company remain afloat while the company works on its core operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "232. Move to cost saving mode. With the expenses of a business of this size, it is not advisable to continue doing everything twice as efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "233. Sell all assets or get rid of it. If the company gets rid of the assets and gets back to its regular revenue level, it can start paying back the company's liabilities, such as a business loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "234. Refinance its debt. The company can refinance its existing debt and use the new money to do more advertising, improve customer service and hire new employees, thus increasing growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "235. Retire its business from the market at the earliest, which could be done with help from the new capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "236. Change the working hours of employee. The company could reduce the working hours of employees for specific purposes after assessing the current status and the business requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "237. Use the excess cash on working capital. If the company has not fully utilized its financial assets, the management should consider using its funds to further its operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "238. Cut expenses. If you are able to keep expenses low, this will help you save some money. It will also ensure that you are profitable without a lot of marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "239. Change or reduce the business model. The company could reduce the sales and marketing departments to cut costs. Another option is to reduce the number of products offered, i.e. to drop a product line altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "240. Reconsider its strategy. Maybe the company should cut down on its marketing expenses (e.g. reduce the campaign budget, lay off some marketing staff) and focus on acquiring new customers instead, increasing its client base while building its credibility and brand name.\n",
      "\n",
      "241. Cut off the company’s employees from company benefits. For as long as they remain with the company, they will continue to be paid a salary and get paid for work completed. However, the company could cancel their employee benefits package completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "242. Close the gap. The company will continue to make sales and expand its product offerings - so there is not as big a gap that can be covered by additional workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "243. Stop trading. The company could terminate all its trading contracts and take loans to replace them which would allow it to reduce its liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "244. Reduce overhead. This should be done before the financial crisis is fully under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "245. Rethink the customer interface. One of the more effective ways to lower business costs and keep clients is to reduce the amount of required sales-time.Q:\n",
      "\n",
      "246. Hire the right people. It may be possible to let go of some of its core employees with a generous severance package, thus ensuring that not only will there be a new workforce but one that is better educated for the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "247. Cut business travel expenses. While this isn’t a good idea if you have only one office in each city, a company usually will not be able to afford to fly across cities because they are spending a huge amount of money on air fares for a few days on a special one-time event.\n",
      "\n",
      "248. Refactor/reorganize operations. This is particularly important for small businesses with multiple product lines. You will need to rejig your product lines, improve your service offerings and make changes to your company policies and procedures in order to reduce costs and improve the bottom line.\n",
      "\n",
      "249. Hire some consultants. For companies without a clear direction, hiring consulting agencies can also help them to find solutions and improve productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "250. Improve company-specific services. In order to keep the company alive and increase traffic to its site, the company could improve its online presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "251. Cut off the perks. This is an easy way to cut costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "252. Hire and train new staff. The company could consider hiring, say, 10 new staff members.\n",
      "\n",
      "253. Seek strategic partners. The company could consider partnering with another business who has enough cash flow to meet urgent needs without incurring more long term liabilities or increasing prices to ensure survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "254. Consider selling out. The company could consider taking it off-shore, or selling it to a company with more cash flowing from the operation than it does in its coffers today.Dancing Man (1934 film)\n",
      "\n",
      "255. Reduce inventory level. The company could consider making certain inventory purchases to avoid inventory losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "256. Cut operational costs (mainly wages and salaries). If the company can get at least a 5% salary cut and employee layoffs will start in the new year, the financial situation will improve quite fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "257. Cut management expenses. The company may decide to cut expenditures in several areas if cash is already thin and its cash flow is low. The company can make cuts by reducing salaries, increasing the number of employees who contribute only by their labor and providing free training to the remaining workers (as an exercise) or by cutting back on the salaries of the top managers who are earning tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "258. Sell off land. The company is currently in the process of selling off land. If you sell off, chances are you will be able to keep the same operating percentage and a new asset. Keep this in mind for planning future growth activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "259. Close the company down temporarily. After assessing it’s financial situation, some investors could provide capital for the company to remain open for a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "260. Close out business deals. In case of problems the management can take a break and let the clients know that the company has to suspend its services till the problem is resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "261. Cut expenses. The company needs to eliminate some overhead costs and could focus on getting back to its original business and also looking after its employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "262. Go into debt. If the company does not have enough money, it may go back to previous shareholders or other investors for that is what can be termed as taking a company under your wing or taking it under your protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "263. Get out of the house. Travel or change jobs or work at the company site. If the company is already in the home office, you can move out and work with the local people (in case you work there too).\n",
      "\n",
      "264. Sell off unprofitable business assets. The company can sell the obsolete or outdated equipment and business software and other assets, which can help the company stay afloat for a few months while reducing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "265. Close down retail outlets. This could improve cash flow in the immediate term, but it will impact the brand image in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "266. Reduce employee stock purchase plan. The company could consider reducing its employee 401k and 403b plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "267. Cut non-competing contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "268. Consider selling assets. The company should consider selling its furniture (in exchange for money borrowed) or any of its equipment which could yield a better return and also attract qualified buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "269. Cut costs and get loans. It makes sense to consolidate its existing debt (which is going to be expensive) with a loan of $20-40 million to improve the company’s financial situation and maintain a cash flow in the immediate term.\n",
      "\n",
      "270. Reduce its annual expenses of production and maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "271. Get the management in another field. A company sometimes becomes too big and the management team loses sight of the customers and its business model. The company can reduce the staff and focus on the core business.\n",
      "\n",
      "272. Sell company assets. Most companies sell a chunk of their assets in the beginning of a downturn, but then sell more assets as cash flow improves. Some companies may be able, after losing their home offices and other expensive real estate, to sell their equipment or vehicles for more than they could get for them in a sale. Others can sell their inventory of personal computers for a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "273. Make strategic decisions. If the company faces the need to create a new product line or increase production capacity, it should consider doing so immediately.\n",

      "\n",
      "275. Cut costs to stay in business\n",
      "\n",
      "276. Restructure the company. In the current economic climate, a company could re-organize itself and lay off as many employees as possible. Some key employees could be placed at entry-level positions while the rest are laid off, thereby increasing efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "277. Sell off businesses and services through private equity. While a firm can sell itself in the form of assets, it will be necessary to sell off businesses and services. This will help the company keep some of its high-value assets and keep some of its current operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "278. Sell the business to a bigger corporation. The company could become a fully owned subsidiary of a bigger corporation and retain full ownership. The company will be forced to cut its marketing expenses since it would no longer have the opportunity to buy the name and brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "279. Sell assets. Selling off non-core assets is an option that can be an appropriate first step.\n",
      "\n",
      "280. Sell assets and sell stock. A company needs to evaluate whether it have any remaining asset which could be sold at a loss on the market to bring in enough money to stay afloat. This could be a company's main product or its plant, or perhaps its valuable intellectual property, which would attract a buyer at the lowest market price. In recent years, this has been a popular way for companies to reduce their debt and stay afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "281. Restructure. The best way to save money is to find a way to decrease company expenses. However, if the potential expense savings is not substantial enough to make the business profitable in the near term, the company could restructure its business to make it profitable through some combination of the above-mentioned options.\n",
      "\n",

      "284. Invest on new areas of business like ecommerce, social networks, and so on. This will help the company grow faster and save on marketing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "285. Pay higher taxes. The company can get more tax savings by making regular payroll deductions for taxes. An idea: Cut all tax savings by 15%.\n",
      "\n",
      "286. Use of a personal trainer (or gym buddy) as a full time employee is a viable cost-saving method.\n",
      "\n",
      "287. Shorten working hours. By cutting working hours of workers and shortening the weekend, the company could cut costs on overtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "288. Increase marketing efforts. The company can use its money-losing business to increase marketing efforts on a regular basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "289. Take out insurance. This would ensure that should they go under, then their owners, employees and other vital business assets will not be left with insufficient capital. There is no point in having a cash flow problem if the insured property is worth too much and the loss is too large.\n",
      "\n",
      "290. Recruit a new in-house CEO. After assessing the liabilities it already has, the company could request a new line of credit which would help it stay afloat for a certain time.\n",

      "291. Donate some of its money to charitable work. This way it can make money and help others while it waits.\n",

      "\n",
      "293. Convert a debt to equity. The company’s debt could be converted to equity using a debt-to-equity exchange ratio that meets the business value.\n",
      "\n",
      "294. Eliminate other expenses. These include unessential services and expenses such as staff salaries, benefits, advertising, research and development, insurance, taxes and so on.\n",

      "295. Lay off some of the lower level employees. If possible, consider transferring those with lower level skill sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "296. Restructure. The company could consider restructuring its operations in such a way so as to bring down its financial losses. This is a tough one because restructuring may cause some financial losses as well as benefits. On a positive note there can be a great deal of savings if the company can bring down the expenses in a cost effective manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "297. Negotiate with vendors to improve service. Negotiations with vendors could help reduce costs, while helping with growth plans. It also helps expand company's existing customer service network and creates new avenues to generate revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "298. Seek a loan. The company can request a loan from a relative bank or from the Internal Credit (which is a government backed bank that helps businesses to raise capital), if the company doesn’t have any viable credit on the basis of its cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "299. Sell assets. If there were any value to the company’s assets, the company could sell them off to gain more market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "300. Sell shares in the company. You can cut off from the board members and shareholders, but this means, in effect, selling shares back. This is the hardest part. What you need to do is to show how much you can contribute by selling them, then you need to convince investors to buy them. Most businesses sell shares in the end but if you want this to happen you need to manage this at the beginning. Some companies choose to have a series of sale options that work like a debt restructuring\n",
      "\n",
      "301. Consolidate existing business units. If possible, consolidate units into two. Doing so will save a considerable amount of money in future.\n",

      "\n",
      "304. Reduce operating costs. This can be done by:\n",
      "\n",
      "305. Consolidate businesses. Businesses which have been previously started or which have been shut down could be combined together or spun out into smaller, more profitable businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "306. Sell assets. It might be advantageous to sell some of the assets which the company needs to acquire for its growth. An asset sale might help the company take control of its growth and avoid the problems of inflow of new customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "307. Cut maintenance expenses and reduce overhead expenditures.\n",
      "\n",
      "308. Cut off employees. If a majority of the workers and managers are not essential to the company's business functions, it could consider to fire some employees. This will allow the company to hire at a later date when the current financial condition has improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "309. Give up control. If a company is not making profits, it should consider giving up its ownership.\n",

      "\n",
      "311. Take a capital injection from a corporate bondholder, a bank or a money lender. The bondholder or bank will get the benefit of a lower rate of return on its investment. However, there is a possibility that the money could increase the company’s financial problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "312. Cut spending on infrastructure. With an understaffed and aging infrastructure, the company could also consider shutting down its operation and refocus on its core business.\n",
      "\n",
      "313. Raise capital by selling shares or equity. The company may need to raise up to 60 million pesos from the sale of shares or stock options.\n",
      "\n",
      "314. Buy back shares. This is a short-term way of reducing the company’s risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "315. Cut non-core costs. By cutting non-core costs, the company could reduce the operating margin while increasing returns on assets. If the company decides in favor of retaining these non-core expenses, or if the expenses are a non-critical portion of a business, a restructuring would be in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "316. Redirect investment funds. The company should reduce expenditure on current projects and turn over investment funds to a new business that would be focused on long term growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "317. Take a loan against it's pension fund. The money that was not used in the acquisition could be converted to equity for the time being, thereby keeping the company in business.\n",
      "\n",
      "318. Outsource. Companies often require their employees to do certain jobs that are repetitive and not necessary. Some companies outsource such jobs so that they can increase their employees' flexibility. Since the company needs to cut costs to survive, they are not able to retain them and will have to pay them more for doing these additional tasks. So the company needs to find a way to outsource such jobs easily, since it would cause significant cost cutting and result in significant reductions in profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "319. Close down operations temporarily or close offices. After accounting for inventory, the company will probably close down its offices to reduce operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "320. Give employees raises: A higher pay scale can help attract top talent who will bring in new clients for the company. A one time raise can be given to a core team leader who can keep the company afloat until the company receives an infusion of capital from a new investor.\n",
      "\n",
      "321. Reduce working capital. Reducing working capital will help it retain current clients. It could also help in reducing its borrowings by using a line of credit from a bank or a government agency.\n",

      "322. Cut personnel. The company could attempt to get rid of the extra expenses by consolidating the current team in to smaller units.\n",
      "\n",
      "323. Cut non-recurring costs where possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "325. Take an overdraft loan. The company could take an overdraft loan so that it can be easily drawn upon against short-term cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "326. Take bankruptcy. There is a chance that the company’s business is so weak that it will be forced to go into bankruptcy. If the company were to go into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, restructuring can help save the company and its customers by transferring the legal responsibility to the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "327. Buy cheap foreign currency. The company could buy a sufficient amount of the precious metal to survive for a longer period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "328. Look for alternative sources of revenue. It would be wise to look for new areas of business where they can expand their footprint, if the market is not there on paper. If they are able to achieve such growth through organic growth they would make money even if they are cutting costs in other areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "329. Consider outsourcing your production. You could outsource production with a partner company to increase the flexibility and reduce the in-house manufacturing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "330. Look into a bank loan. Borrowing $10,000,000 for six months at a time has the advantage of being able to repay the loan in the same period. However, the company will have to pay interest on the loan, and this amount could be reduced by a third or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "331. Redirect expenses. The company will incur additional expenses that did not have before, like legal expenses, the cost of implementing IT, etc. However, they would do a better job and be able to survive for longer period and also pay their debts as well.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "375. Get out of debt soon. With a business failure of such magnitude as the one which occurred on September 11, the company should reduce its indebtedness to a fraction of what it is and then reduce costs significantly. This will allow the company to use future resources for the benefit of the shareholders instead of only to repay itself.\n",

      "\n",
      "379. Cut costs or increase revenue and profit. Another option would be a long-term contract which has a number of benefits over a short-term one.

      "\n",
      "385. Eliminate cash flow problems. Cash flow problems are inevitable in business. If the company is cash-flow positive, cash is flowing in; if the company is cash-flow negative, it is paying out more than it takes in. In some cases, the company could ask the banks to increase the amount of the cash flow problem by loaning it additional money.\n",

      "\n",
      "391. Make a series of acquisitions. A company could consider a combination strategy where it acquires more businesses, thus reducing the amount of its loans. The acquisition strategy also eliminates debt and the company only has to pay out small interest rates.\n",

      "418. Use the remaining profits to acquire a better business. The company has to consider the possibility that the government will stop giving subsidies for its products or that the market shifts in a negative manner as a result of the crisis. The company should assess whether the government would like to buy products made by the company or if it might be able to outsource manufacturing and services to other countries.

      "468. Take some time off. Employees may lose an easy-filled holiday as the company may need to go back to its regular operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "469. Close down the company and close down its operations. The company could also close down its business operations, but not every company must do this. Some companies have limited cash-flow but still keep their operations in place because they have a strong brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "470. Go bankrupt. If the company doesn’t have a large enough balance sheet to be put on the government’s asset list, it’s time to go bankrupt. Not only would it leave it with a massive debt, but also it would leave the company’s creditors with nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "471. Sell assets. Depending on the assets purchased and its market value, that is, in terms of the amount of money the owners would be willing to pay, the company could decide to sell the assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "472. Go public via a Share Exchange Offer (SEO). Some of the company’s best managers are already selling their shares via SEO – one of which, Mr. B.K Reddy, is already selling up to Rs. 3,000 crore worth of shares a day. Companies go public through SEOs, and the shares start trading on the Stock Exchange within a day or two. These shares would initially be traded at a premium over the going market rate. As the price of shares\n",
      "\n",
      "473. Use stock options as an incentive. When stock options are converted, it will most likely create a huge profit for the company. If the options are exercised for the maximum amount, it will increase the valuation of the company by huge margins, which will benefit the shareholders. There are many companies which use stock options as their main source of profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "474. Get rid of unnecessary costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "475. Find a cheap supplier. To cut costs, businesses should consider finding better quality raw materials and/or better quality products at a low price.\n",
      "\n",
      "476. Hire some part-time employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "477. Look for opportunities elsewhere. If the company is not making enough profit to cover its expenses, it must explore opportunities in the market for a comparable position where it can improve its business margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "478. Sell the product. Selling an expensive part of the company’s assets would provide a cash yield which is a cash cow, and therefore, would justify the investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "479. Change its business model to avoid obsolescence. When businesses run into financial problems, they generally retrench their way towards survival by changing their business model — usually with a new one but eventually with a business to make it last.\n",
      "\n",
      "480. Look for alternative markets. The company will need to look for new business opportunities outside of its current field. After all, a company cannot sustain all its employees if it is forced to cut down or layoff them. Therefore, the company should look for alternative markets where it can generate profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "481. Use a software-based accounting system. The software system helps the accounting department in taking quick, accurate financial statements rather than depending upon paper-based accounting system.\n",
      "\n",
      "482. Keep inventory on hand. Since the cost of producing products is the same whether it is sold or not, this is a good way to reduce inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "483. Cut spending on new building and equipment. The company could consider delaying acquisition of new building and machinery until after having a plan in place to take on new clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "484. Sell some operations and assets. Some businesses could sell off a certain number of operations to another company in the hope of future profit by doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "485. Buy back shares. A company may buy back shares in the market in order to buy back all the shares at the exact price they were bought in.\n",
      "\n",
      "486. Sell its business. The company could sell its business to a smaller company, increasing its ability to maintain its operations and continue serving its current clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "487. Buy inventory. If your business has too much inventory, consider selling some or a combination of low demand items to increase profits. The cash profits from sale of inventory can be used to help repay the new venture financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "488. Reduce the number of new projects. This could mean that you end up with more unmet clients, but at the cost of higher client attrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "489. Use a new marketing agency. There are several marketing agencies offering cheap rates. Also, the client can choose a marketing firm that charges by the word rather than the number of clicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "490. Move headquarters to another city. By relocating the company out of its existing building, the company’s new location will be more convenient for the workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "491. Sell off assets – This should be considered a very serious move which would have potential tax implications. However, the tax department is the least of the company’s worries with business ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "492. Sell or buy a business at a loss. A business could sell the company or buy it at a loss since this is not a profitable venture.\n",
      "\n",
      "493. Move into a new business. This could come from selling out entire business. However, this will not be easy since the company management needs to ensure everything is in the right place.\n",
      "\n",
      "494. Retire the CEO. If he or she doesn't perform as expected, let the company management decide who will replace them.\n",
      "\n",
      "495. Get the best possible advice on the matter from the financial advisors of your choice, including experienced ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "496. Turn off the phones. Turn off all the cellphones and mobile data lines, and turn off all the outside mailboxes. Do not order items from the company’s vendors through these “circulation” methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "497. Consider selling assets. When the company has little to no cash to pay for operations, it could consider selling assets and raising money to repay the borrowed credit line.\n",
      "\n",
      "498. Take out insurance policies on key employees. Having an insurance plan that covers both the company and its employees will be a prudent investment at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "499. Find new customers. Finding and retaining new clients without losing money is the key to saving the company. In many cases an inbound marketing strategy will be as effective as hiring a fulltime employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "500. Retrench staff, while retaining key personnel that has worked with the company very closely for a long period.\n",
      "\n",
      "501. Delay expansion. A delay in expansion plans could possibly save as much as half of the company’s expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "502. Sell the company’s other assets to pay back the loan. A company’s real estate can be sold for cash to pay off such a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "503. Reduce employee head count by 50% or more. An initial estimate shows that the company has just 200 employees. This could be reduced to about 75-100 with some savings on salaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "504. Negotiate with employees. The company could discuss a short-term reduction in salaries, if possible, or let go of some employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "505. Hire new sales-people. New sales-people will be hired to replace the old sales-people.\n",
      "\n",
      "506. Seek a partner or acquire a competitor. This step may not seem necessary to the management, but it’s good to remember that this is a business, and it is a business at its core.\n",
      "\n",
      "507. Get an infusion of capital from outside. Businesses which have suffered in the recent financial turmoil could ask for a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "508. Cut back on perks. Some companies have gotten in the bad habit of providing perks to executives. While they are good for people who do the jobs, these perks cost the company money in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "509. Reduce stock prices. This is a more long run strategy but it requires the management to stay disciplined and ensure it does all it can to keep the stock price attractive in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "510. Cut expenses – cutting expenses would help the company stay afloat with increased revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "511. Reduce marketing expenses. This could also prevent any future problems and help it grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "512. Cut salaries. Cut salaries might mean layoffs in the short term, but may also trigger the end of the company’s existence due to its large outstanding liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "513. Increase staff numbers. The company can add to its employee base and in the process, reduce the expenses (outgo) of providing employee benefits such as salary and healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "514. Transfer operations to a foreign country, India being one of the best options due to its financial support while it searches for a new business concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "515. Cut staff. This might cut down employee numbers as well, but the company should try to make sure that it does not compromise the quality of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "516. Sell assets of high value. Assets of high value and high liquidity like land and factories should be sold to reduce its current liabilities in case of any major downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "517. Look for potential partner. One area where the company might consider to cut costs temporarily, is to look for other investment opportunities in the markets it operates.\n",
      "\n",
      "518. Cut production. If the company has a production deficit, it could easily absorb another $10 million in production costs by reducing some production line.\n",
      "\n",
      "519. Cut services. This is the first one which people don’t like to do due to the impact on other businesses. It could save up to 50% in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "520. Move some or all of the current clients to a different department. This move would ensure that your company is not dependent on one client, but that every client can have multiple vendors to choose from.\n",
      "\n",
      "521. Take out a bank guarantee. A bank guarantee helps to give banks a certain sum of money to guarantee the company's ability to continue operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "522. Hire a business consultant. The company could hire the help of a business consultant who could help with strategic planning and improve the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "523. Use a cash infusion to buy back stock. The company needs to cut down the stock price by 10-15% and use the proceeds to buy back company stock at the current market price.\n",
      "\n",
      "524. Offer to sell. The company could consider selling out to an acquirer; there are many companies willing to buy a startup company, especially one in distress such as one under bankruptcy protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "525. Sell products. After cutting marketing costs it may make sense for the company to reduce the product lines it manufactures and focus these on areas where the customers’ need is not strong but which provide an opportunity to increase the company’s income.\n",
      "\n",
      "526. Increase the number of on-line orders. The company could consider increasing its total number of orders, so not all of them must be completed on paper. On-line sales will cost less, but the company will have more time to get responses and feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "527. Reduce overhead costs. The company needs to look at eliminating all its unnecessary expenses to reduce its expenses that would increase its debt as much as 15-25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "528. Consolidate departments. Some corporations are experiencing cash flow shortages and need to consolidate all business functions. Consolidating departments will allow the companies to reduce operating expenses and save money.\n",
      "\n",
      "529. Sell. The company can try selling its assets, for example the company car, or the business it was operating before. This way, it could get a more stable financing, while its other operations (such as IT) continue to run. It also gets a better return for the time it takes to complete the sale than a complete takeover of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "530. Increase share prices. If share price is still low, company management could take steps to increase the share prices which would attract more customers as it is. This could also help the company to make profits while retaining its core operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "531. Sell off its assets. Any company that is under a lot of financial stress will not want to keep any of its assets. After assessing the assets and liabilities, the company management can decide whether to sell off some assets or continue to hold the old assets and retain the new liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "532. Cut expenses. The company should look to reduce expenses in order to lower its burden upon its shareholders. The company may cut employees salaries and benefits. It could also consider eliminating perks but only as a last resort due to the high cost of maintaining the perks.\n",
      "\n",
      "533. Sell assets and reduce debt. The company could possibly sell some assets, increase its debt-to-equity ratio, and lower the interest rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "534. Reduce capital spending. Depending on the company’s capital costs, a reduction in capital spending can also be a wise choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "535. Cut expenses associated with non-core operations. For example, look out for unnecessary purchase of office furniture and pay for it using cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "536. Cut operational costs, that will help the company. The primary cost is office rent for space which is used as office space. The cost reduction in office rent can be significant if the company has been growing at a rate in excess of 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "537. Reduce expenses. The first step to reducing expenses should be taking a better look at every element of the company’s business, including its current staff. If the company can reduce its expenses, then this will mean the company could remain financially afloat while cutting costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "538. Shorten or increase the working hours of part-time staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "539. Move to a new office location. New locations make it easier to meet with customers and prospects alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "540. Cut expenses through efficiency improvements. The company could cut the cost of product and service, by eliminating the less-desirable products and services, to increase their profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "541. Convert business to a limited liability corporate structure in order to avoid a lot of tax liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "542. Close the company. If the company were to close it would have the most to lose and most to gain. It might look like that decision is the safest, but we are not always right.\n",
      "\n",
      "543. Reduce salaries by 20% to eliminate redundancy in the current team.\n",
      "\n",
      "544. Layoff part of its workforce. This would relieve the core team and improve the company's potential growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "545. Cut staff travelling to the client sites. The company needs a number of people to deal with the needs of current clients. But now there is just no way it can make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "546. Cut employees’ perks. The company could eliminate or significantly reduce benefits, salaries, and the size of the company’s expense account to make a good financial move at an opportune time.\n",
      "\n",
      "547. Buy new buildings to expand the business. The company may have to borrow a lot of money for this, and it will help that borrow money is paid back faster if the company has fewer assets to finance it.\n",
      "\n",
      "548. Consider selling company. A company facing declining profits and increasing costs can consider selling the company to another company in which they are already an equal partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "549. Sell assets. The company can sell its land and building when it is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "550. Buy back shares. The company could buy back all its shares at a discounted price and use the funds for further investments to increase its capital base, which should help it float a bit longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "551. Sell assets. Assets can be sold for as low as the market value.\n",
      "\n",
      "552. Purchase a non-core business. A business might need to be rebranded and its operations might need to be tweaked to make it more cost effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "553. Seek credit enhancement loan. A traditional line of credit could be used to support the company during this period. The only thing to watch out is that at this time the company would need a higher credit rating before it can obtain the line of credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "554. Reduce payroll. If the company would need to increase their production cost or reduce its payroll size, it should consider reducing it in the immediate term.\n",
      "\n",
      "555. Take out a corporate bank loan. Bank loans can help companies in difficult times by providing some short term loans, while also relieving some of the debt that already exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "556. Raise short-term debt. The company may be in a deep financial hole until the next wave of recovery, so it may want to raise short term debt to take out some of its debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "557. Stop doing promotional offers. Doing so could incur further losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "558. Use the assets such as land and buildings for another purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "559. Consider downsizing. If the company is already running out of cash, it is better to reduce its workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "560. Find ways to reduce overhead. After all costs are tallied up, it might be wise to lay off employees to reduce overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "561. Close the plant. If the core team agrees to this, the company can close its existing company-owned plant or acquire such a plant from a competitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "562. Stop paying its mortgage in cash. The company could invest back some of its cash flow back into its business operations, by giving it the use of borrowed funds, which would enable it to continue its operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "563. Diversify its assets. Selling its major businesses may bring some quick profits and boost the company’s confidence. It will still need financing for projects further down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "564. Get another line of credit. The company also needs another line of credit, to help it survive for a longer period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "565. Reduce the number of products or services the company delivers. The company’s offerings could be drastically reduced in number, thereby maintaining a level of competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "566. Delay capital expenditures. One of the ways to cut costs, however, is capital expenditures that would not impact the core business of the company. By delaying capital expenditures, the company can benefit from current investments, as interest on investment grows and more businesses in the market compete for the company’s customer base.\n",
      "\n",
      "567. Invest in new projects. New projects could have their own set of risks. However, they are very cost effective too. So, they may be an excellent way to grow the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "568. Stop marketing. If the company decides to stop marketing, it can cut costs significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "569. Hire fewer staff. If an employee joins the company, he or she will be treated as independent contractors and will receive no benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "570. Sell off assets. A company can dispose of non-core assets and sell off non-core assets which are easy enough to sell with little or no problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "571. Buy equipment not used by other businesses. With no regular customer base, if a new client asks for services, the company management may need to look for a supplier who offers a high quality of service and low initial costs in a good location.\n",
      "\n",
      "572. Take out a personal loan to cover the initial costs. If the company can’t find cash reserves to provide loans of its own, getting a personal loan can be a great way to begin saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "573. Reduce the number of employees. After assessing that the company can cut staff by a quarter by the next financial year (i.e. cut the workforce by 20% instead of 30%), the company can consider downsizing the existing personnel by 20% instead of 20%, and increase the number of new employees by 1% (this is based on the annual payroll).\n",
      "\n",
      "574. Consider reducing payroll costs. The company needs to cut payroll costs to make more ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "575. Convert to another company. Alternatively, the company could acquire the intellectual property of another company. The key problem with this approach is the ‘time-to-purchase’ that would take place in order for the company to realize the potential gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "576. Increase working capital. When the core team members are laid off, they lose their income and their training and experience. But the company could take an extra cash infusion from the bank or outside sources to increase the working capital reserves of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "577. Reduce business loans by 90-95%.\n",
      "\n",
      "578. Change its tax policies. The company should consider altering its tax policies, perhaps changing from having profits tax deductions, to sales tax deductions, to take advantage of a new sales tax regime in Malaysia, which encourages consumers to buy goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "579. Reduce inventory. Selling off inventory would help the company cut costs in the short term, but this will not be long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "580. Sell assets. Any major assets owned by the company, such as computers or a factory, could be sold to an outside party to help finance the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "581. Buy new assets. Purchasing newer and/or more cost effective machinery will reduce business costs\n",
      "\n",
      "582. Cut back on marketing activities. This would not reduce revenues immediately but would also save company from the negative impact of the cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "583. Increase the number of vendors (partners, for joint ventures) the company uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "584. Sell company assets. Once the company has started up again from selling its equipment, offices and machinery; it may be able to sell this assets for a large profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "585. Sell land holdings. If the land assets are not worth much, but the company has no other options for getting money, it could sell off its large holdings in the real estate market, helping it recover from the current financial problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "586. Look for business partners. Companies can get new clients by entering into business partnerships or by acquiring other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "587. Pay off debts. For example, instead of continuing to pay bills of £20,000,000 per year, the company could reduce its annual costs by £1.00 million. In doing this, it will not need to raise fresh capital, therefore it would not create a huge risk of business failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "588. Invest in research and development. The company could do research and development to bring new products to the market soon. It can also use this money to cover expenses such as salaries and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "589. Make the company’s employees work longer hours. During the lean period, employees are not expected to work overtime hours, so cut down on the number of overtime hours worked. The company should also review its overtime policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "590. Redesign the website, making it user friendly, attractive, and useful to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "591. Sell the company. If the company's future is uncertain, it's better to sell it in order to reduce debts while retaining the source of income.\n",
      "\n",
      "592. Sell off assets. This option may sound crazy to others, but it will work. The company could sell a large asset- one that has significant value to its customers. This is a business decision that can be made after assessing the worth of the company today.\n",
      "\n",
      "593. Reduce operational costs. It is possible to reduce operations expenses by closing small and infrequent branches. This could help the company get a stable clientele.\n",
      "\n",
      "594. Take out a loan. The company management has to consider taking a strategic loan from another company. This way, the company can get a loan and invest in the business. This type of loan could be short or long term depending on the company’s need at that particular time.\n",
      "\n",
      "595. Reduce the staff. Employees may not have enough savings, and could use it for other expenses. Another way out is for the business to merge with another firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "596. Increase taxes. Raising taxes would help the company collect more taxes than it already expects.\n",
      "\n",
      "597. Sell shares. After the company lays off a number of employees, it could sell the shares its management holds to another investor that doesn't mind using the money on new investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "598. Hire a chief operating officer or a chief financial officer. These professionals could step in and lead the company until the company starts producing profits again.\n",
      "\n",
      "599. Seek new investors or funding sources to support its business. Getting funding will help the company stay afloat until some suitable buyers show up.\n",
      "\n",
      "600. Reduce or give up some investment projects. If the business has a profitable line of business that could help offset some of the costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "601. Reduce staff training. Staff could be trimmed down temporarily to deal with the financial crunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "602. Find a partner. If the company is forced into bankruptcy, it could still attempt to find a new company with similar business in order to continue operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "603. Transfer to a smaller regional company. Once a company has fallen into financial difficulties, a takeover of the company by another company with a similar business with the same target clientele may be financially viable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "604. Increase dividend yields. Dividends might not be the deciding factor of a company’s success or failure. However, they are a very good form of a ‘soft cost’ which can be used to support the company by increasing both its cash inflow and free capital. On the other hand, the extra capital available with a higher dividend rate can be used to improve the company’s overall efficiency, and can be reinvested in the business in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "605. Sell or lease its machinery/equipment. The company could find a buyer who would be willing to buy the machinery at this time or at the soon-to-be-launched new product.\n",

      "607. Invest in other business operations. There are many businesses that do not get traction due to lack of funding. The company could take the opportunity and invest in an alternative business that would get traction.\n",

      "610. Refinance the debt. A bank loan is a valuable tool in the cut-cost and reduction-in-services department. Bank loans usually carry a high interest rate, and after payment of the loan, the bank has to pay an interest to the original lender.\n",
      "\n",
      "611. Sell off some of its assets. Some assets can be sold off immediately, for example, the company's land could probably be purchased by someone who will build a new business on the site with the land as collateral. The company needs to think about this type of sale carefully though.\n",
      "\n",
      "612. Consolidate operations. The company could consolidate its operations with two or more companies, merging with the two or more companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "613. Seek investment or equity funding. The company might as well seek funding first from partners or a bank. It can take a loan if a bank won’t or can’t offer the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "614. Redesign the website. The company should take an in-depth look into the website its clients and potential clientele have been using for a long spell for betterment of the website.\n",

      "618. Cut costs for internal operations. For example, the company management could consider cutting the costs for food, and could also cut down on salaries of key personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "619. Take a cash advance. If all its cash flows come from selling its assets - which they usually do not, it will need cash in the bank for other purchases.\n",

      "621. Sell assets or sell off other parts of the business. These types of decisions are made only when the board is fully confident that there is no future for the company, and that there is really no other course.\n",
      "\n",
      "622. Reorganized the structure of the company. Some companies keep their operational processes separate from the product or service. Reorganizing the company could save money by using a single IT solution that could handle both operational and marketing functions that would also reduce the possibility of costly mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "623. Don’t take a salary cut. It is better to try and attract new customers by having more work, rather than make cutbacks to lower your expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "624. Reduce overhead expenses. The company management should reduce overhead where possible. This will allow it to cut costs further.\n",
      "\n",
      "625. Sell assets. The company could sell assets, which can be sold to the new buyers at a reasonable price and at which they will accept a lower rate of return.\n",
      "\n",
      "626. Cut operating expenses. If the Company currently spends $1,000 for each customer who visits its website, then cut the number of customers to $500.\n",

      "628. Create a reserve fund. The company could seek to create a reserve fund for possible future financial obligations, which it had not previously faced.\n",
      "\n",
      "629. Pay off employees’ vacation and time-off wages. If workers have to be available for work, the company management should pay their wages directly to them or they can be paid at a higher hourly rate.\n",

      "\n",
      "631. Use an external consultant. Outsourcing will help cut costs while keeping the core team intact, but the potential problems or risks may arise during the transition phase that may not immediately be visible. You should discuss the transition concerns with the consultant. (Note: Your external consultant should be an unbiased, honest and experienced professional who can help you reduce your costs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "632. Consider outsourcing. Companies often choose technology as a cost-effective means of saving money. At a time when the US corporate tax rate has reached 33% and companies cannot afford to keep employee payroll as low as they could, it can turn out to be a better option than reducing budgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "633. Reduce capital spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "634. Re-organise departments/processes. This decision could be justified if the company's core competency is declining. Re-organisation process could also be used to save money and time.\n",

      "635. Create a surplus line of credit for the company's current and future business expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "636. Create a reserve fund. The company would create a reserve fund to pay suppliers and take care of emergencies. Once this fund is replenished it will be used to pay its ongoing bills and it will then be available for projects. This would help in reducing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "637. Look for a strategic buyer. The current market for companies who have turned a profit can be unpredictable, and it can take six to twelve months before the potential buyers appear. If the company decides to sell at a reduced price, a strategic buyer who can help the company sell its products at a reduced price or even get a better terms can come into play. The potential buyers usually are a combination of private investors, local organizations, and high-technology companies who want to purchase at a reduced price due to\n",
      "\n",
      "638. Make drastic cuts in salaries and benefits. If the company is not currently profitable, then salary and benefits should be cut. At the same time, they should not raise prices of the product too drastically and reduce product range instead. It is better to ask the employees to work harder for lower salaries and to make the same salaries as before as part of the regular pay package and at the same time get a raise on the salary for a better work environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "639. Cut costs for employee welfare/benefits. If the company keeps the costs of employee welfare/benefits down, it will be able to slash the salaries of its existing employees.\n",

      "640. Buy back inventory. The company can buy back a part of its products, if it doesn’t feel it has enough to offer to its clients\n",
      "\n",
      "641. Transfer employees. If the company has the resources (people, money, and technology) to acquire an external company for the purpose of outsourcing, this would help the company to reduce its cost as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "642. Move some offices onto the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "643. Change product lines. The company could temporarily stop selling certain services while evaluating new products.\n",
      "\n",
      "644. Reduce staff. As the CEO begins to take over the company operations, his main job will be to monitor all the other employees regarding their skills and performance. If there are any employees who are capable of performing the job, he should bring them into the fold.\n",
      "\n",
      "645. Delay repayment of a new line of credit. The company could delay paying back the loan until after the recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "646. Review the company's sales forecasts. Based on the forecast the company now has in hand, the company management cannot be sure of where it stands now. Therefore, the board should reconsider the sales forecasts, and see if any growth areas need to be identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "647. Give up the services. The company could decide to offer its services to free of cost. They could also offer the staff to find a temporary work under their contract with the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "648. Seek out and take on a new supply contract. The company could look for a new supply contract to help it cut expenses, which can be done while the management is still holding on to its client base.\n",
      "\n",
      "649. Redirect expenses. Some expenses will no longer need to be managed or paid for. For example, some services or products can be contracted out, or some operations could be automated or outsourced and the income would be used for expansion or improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "650. Sell company equipment. Sell some of the company's more valuable assets to reduce its overall debt position before asking for a bank loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "651. Cut R&D spending. The company’s R&D spending can easily run into hundreds of millions, and cutting back on the spending by 10% will cut down the R&D costs by 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "652. Stop paying tax dues. The company could temporarily stop paying capital gains tax. The tax would be reduced, which will result in a lower tax bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "653. Buy back inventory. To increase the company's overall profit margins, the management should purchase back inventory to reduce the inventory cost and increase its profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "654. Cut taxes. Cut company tax for six years, thus giving the company's creditors a chance to buy back the company and sell it back to its core team in the event of bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "655. Reduce expenses to offset costs. If possible, the company could invest in additional R&D and R&D research could be brought down to reasonable levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "656. Find better management. Once the company realizes that it cannot stay afloat, it must find a way to become viable. The best course to take might be to increase the number of managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "657. Cut staff below the level of what is required. The company could cut 20-30 full-time staff members at the same time, giving way for others to come in and help the company meet any emergencies that may arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "658. Take out bank overdraft. The company could take out an overdraft on its existing bank accounts and have the overdraft removed after a certain amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "659. Improve customer service. The company should review and improve its current customer service and follow up processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "660. Sell stock. The financial head of the company could sell a large section (20-30%) of its stock holdings to raise money. After buying back in to the stock it would again be able to use the money to further restructure the company’s financial health.\n",
      "\n",
      "661. Sell part of the company. In this case, the management wants to reduce the size of the company and keep the business in the market. This might not necessarily include selling the main line of production at a higher price, as the company could also choose to sell a lesser line of products from the factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "662. Cut non-essential administrative expenses. Some expenses, such as those to run the HR department, can be completely eliminated without any impact on the company revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "663. Recycling money. By selling off unwanted or unneeded equipment, materials and goods, the company could save some of its cash, thus avoiding having to take a large hit in salary expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "664. Increase the size of the office. This would also help to keep the headcount low for a time. It would be a good exercise to evaluate the need for additional employees. You may need to make some minor changes in the company’s structure to make space available for additional employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "665. Consolidate to save costs. The company could consolidate all its operations into a single unit, reducing inflow of potential new clients, and thus making it more possible to cut marketing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "666. Review its product and service offerings and look for opportunities to cut fees and/or lower costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "667. Hire new employees. Paying employees less, and offering higher salaries, might be able to absorb an immediate cost of around $100,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "668. Reduce expenses in the company’s business. Reducing expenses will save the company a lot of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "669. Take a distribution cut. This can be a one on one sales cut or a group distribution cut across product lines. Whichever way, the company could minimize the losses from the loss of key customers and keep the company afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "670. Cut its profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "671. Transfer customers to your new operations. If the company has a lot of customers, and most of them had left due to problems in the past few years, they should transfer these customers to the new branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "672. Make a restructuring effort. The company could reduce its headcount by reducing the time it takes for paperwork, but in so doing reduces efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "673. Short sales. Selling one or two of your company’s assets could lead to a significant increase in liquidity, as the buyer will need to pay little to no financing out because it has a good credit score.\n",
      "\n",
      "674. Sell your company to a larger company. A sale could mean an influx of cash, but what if the buyer is not the one who originally put money into the company or if it's already run into a financial hole? If the buyer wants to keep running the company (like it ran in the first place during the startup - it has a good track record to the investors, so it's hard to imagine any of them would want to walk away from a company which is currently making money), then the\n",
      "\n",
      "675. Reduce working capital. To reduce working capital, some cash needs to be transferred to the bank. In many cases, the transfer could include company assets like bank deposits. The company would use the cash to service its existing liabilities. After working out the amount, the company could use the funds to improve its marketing efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "676. Hire lawyers. A company lawyer could help in negotiating a better contract with the staff in return for some percentage of the company's sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "677. Change the business model. It's been proved that a company running a sole trading model is less profitable than companies using multiple branches and multiple warehouses to supply multiple clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "678. Cut salaries. The most obvious financial saving is to cut salaries drastically for the current year. This will allow the management to plan the budget while cutting the expenses in each department.\n",
      "\n",
      "679. Sell other assets. Some companies have acquired another business over the years which has not performed as well as the company’s own business. If the company is selling the other business, it can try reducing the liabilities of the buyer of the business and save the company money.\n",
      "\n",
      "680. Sell off non-profitable assets to reduce capital expenditure.\n",
      "\n",
      "681. Reduce its overhead. After assessing whether it needs to reduce its overhead to survive for the next one or two years, the company could try to cut it to the minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "682. Reduce capital expenditure. The company needs capital to grow. It could invest in new systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "683. Retire older workers. The company already has too many staff- too many employees and too many machines and the current workers no longer have all the skills it currently needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "684. Improve product or service. This can be achieved by getting the products or services to be updated or improving its own products with the help of innovative or more affordable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "685. Increase operational efficiencies. For instance, employees could be asked to reduce time spent in the office, with a reduced number of phone and meetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "686. Sell assets. If the company is going to continue to float on its core clientele, it may have to sell assets to stay in business. Selling the company's office building, factory and other valuable properties would take care of some of the short term liabilities the company has.\n",
      "\n",
      "687. Hire temporary workers to do work normally handled by the temporary staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "688. Seek a tax benefit. There’s a lot to be said for using the tax code wisely. The company would be better off applying for a small business loan that reduces business tax rate and not a bigger loan that could give them a tax benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "689. Consolidate operations. If the business has many operations, it is wise to find a way to better co-ordinate operations to make more profitable use of the resources of each department. By taking the time to consolidate operations, the company will be able to achieve economies of scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "690. Consider refinancing its current commercial building. The company’s need to cut costs may have forced it to reduce and close down operations at the current location as a way to free up cash to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "691. Stop using cash reserves. The company needs to cut its cash reserves to make it more self-sufficient. The company has a strong balance sheet and could use other means to secure cash to meet this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "692. Sell a large stake in the company. The company might find it difficult to sell its entire stock, but a good buy-out price could be reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "693. Close down operations and invest in growth. This includes eliminating expenses that are not making money.\n",
      "\n",
      "694. Purchase shares of the company. This would help provide cash to pay the short-term bills while allowing the company to retain its profits and control stake. A company which has no control over its assets cannot determine when and how it wishes to spend its profits for the short-term without the support of a buyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "695. Reorganize the company’s inventory. This can help to maintain the company’s cost effective approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "696. Look at cost cutting measures such as reducing overhead cost or increasing production speed. Reduce cost can be attained by increasing the operating margin or increasing the production speed by reducing the total capital outlays. The first one might not be a very viable option for small businesses which are dependent on an initial budget from the investors. But by increasing the sales and cost margin the company's cash flow will be stabilized and the total amount of the debt will not go beyond an acceptable level.\n",
      "\n",
      "697. Cut expenses. The company could reduce its spending by 15-20% to bring in some more income. This will be temporary, but will lead to better financial situation and a higher retention rate of employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "698. Seek funding for a major expansion. The new money would allow better performance, and could be used to cut down on the high marketing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "699. Get ready for a cash crunch. It may be wise to put some money aside for a possible cash crunch. The cash cushion will come out after the company makes a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "700. Consider selling products to local grocery stores (for re-sale or for free) in return for lower prices at the outlet store. If there are a lot of local companies wanting to be associated with this deal, it might prove profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "701. Recruit new people. New hires would ensure a constant increase in revenue and can also help to reduce costs further because they are less expensive to train. After all, one of the biggest issues in the recent recession that companies have been facing is that they could not get the people that they need, and therefore were forced to layoff everyone of them. This can be prevented by taking a new hire and giving it a contract with a limited amount of time for work, and another contract that stipulates that\n",
      "\n",
      "702. Cut payroll and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "703. Offer free stock and an opportunity to buy back shares at a better price. Since the company has to raise capital in the future, it could offer a share purchase program, where the investor could buy the company's stock at a discount.\n",
      "\n",
      "704. Cut employee’s wages. In addition to reducing marketing, employees with less and high-paid jobs can’t expect to increase their gross income at the same pace as the high paid staff. With a pay check in hand, there is no point in keeping a high-paid worker, who was earning a lot of money, and reducing his workload.\n",
      "\n",
      "705. Reduce salaries. Many times the costs of salaries are underestimated. This could result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The company could look into outsourcing the salaries to save the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "706. Restructure its management team. Cut some of the bloated and poorly performing management team(s), and hire a few more competent managers, which may cut annual profits by 25% or more. This will also reduce expenses and can result in a stable and even higher return on investment, which in turn can be used to purchase another company or build a new one, as described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "707. Reduce advertising expenses. The company could reduce marketing expenses by 10X to 20X to reduce costs and increase profits as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "708. Cut expenses. The more you cut the expenses, the more money you will have to pay your creditors during the insolvency, the greater your chance of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "709. Buy back unitholders. The unitholders will then pay a dividend regularly until it reaches the desired level and all of them are redeemed.\n",
      "\n",
      "710. Increase turnover rates. This is very cost-effective way to generate higher volumes of revenues. The company needs to ensure a high turnover rate to maintain its competitiveness. Turnover rates are influenced by various factors such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "711. Lay off an employee. The company should look for ways of keeping employees by eliminating their jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "712. Make a voluntary layoff. Lay off all employees without being forced to do so. This is an optional procedure, as the company can later request for re-employment of affected employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "713. Don’t give away valuable equipment and information, like computers, servers, and servers.\n",
      "\n",

      "715. Buy the company with a foreign buyer. This would enable the company to stay afloat in the present crisis and help the company avoid the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "716. Reduce expenses. With a smaller clientele and no new business, the company will no longer have to waste its expenses on advertising. It could cut expenses to boost profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "717. Move to a different location. By relocating to a more convenient location, the employees would enjoy better wages, better living conditions, and will also have a better chance of rehiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "718. Reduce debt. If any of the company's debt is long-term, then it will not get paid off in short periods. So, the company could consider reducing debt by issuing bonds, reducing debt with cash flow from operations, or entering a long term bond issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "719. Exit the market. If the company is currently in a market that it wants to exit, then the first thing they can do is to sell the company to a new owner who will do it as a new entity for some amount of money and take the liabilities out of the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "720. Consolidate its operation. It would save on expenses while cutting down cost per employee and increase profit per employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "721. Get rid of unproductive property. The business could decide to eliminate unproductive property which is out of its control. The company has limited financial resources, its business model will deteriorate with time and it needs to keep the existing assets and make use of a bank loan to get rid of unproductive assets and invest elsewhere.\n",

      "724. Don’t expand too quickly with any given project. There are a number of ways to manage and cut costs and stay afloat for a reasonable period of time. This is a hard process but the company management can look at the business as a patient in the emergency room who needs to be given the proper care and attention.\n",

      "727. Sell assets. Selling assets can help a company to keep its costs down while enabling it to grow in business and survive. It can involve some painful decisions. However, if there are assets whose value in the market is high enough, then selling them is a good decision and can greatly contribute to the survival of the organization.\n",

      "734. Buy back shares. The stock market can sometimes be irrational, so buy back shares to buy out a share or two from the company’s shareholders. This is very common when a company is in trouble financially.\n",
      "\n",
      "735. Buy new computers. The company can buy more computers and laptops to cut down on overhead and also save on space as the current laptops are occupying valuable floor space and the laptop department cannot be eliminated without significant loss in productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "736. Invest in new technologies/products. The company should consider investing in new technologies that would make existing businesses much more productive. Newer technologies can also reduce costs associated with the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "737. Invest in marketing. If the company is struggling to find a new direction with its marketing efforts, it should invest in some new marketing systems and strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "738. Sell parts of the asset. Any asset the company has can be sold in order to reduce the company’s liabilities, and reduce the amount of debt it must service.\n",
      "\n",
      "739. Sell land and assets. Although the company will incur huge selling price on any land and assets sold by it, this will help it pay back all its liabilities in the course of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "740. Sell off some real estate and equipment. This will allow the company to cut out the debt and allow it to pay the debt in an orderly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "741. Transfer key functions to the lower level of the organization. This will help in reducing complexity of the organization, and reduce costs with little effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "742. Look for a job in another company where the pay is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "743. Start a new line of business. This will help the company to acquire more contracts than it can possibly support.\n",
      "\n",
      "744. Take some non-perishable goods for the office. By giving the office employees some time off, the company can reduce the demand for goods from the customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "745. Sell the company. After having reviewed all of these possibilities, the company management would make a final choice. They would decide either to stay afloat with the present clients/customers, or to go out of business permanently.\n",
      "\n",
      "746. Sell off assets. A company can’t avoid selling and re-evaluating its assets if it doesn’t have any. The company could sell the company-owned buildings and equipment at a discount, and use the proceeds to pay off some of the other creditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "747. Recruit new employees. If the company has sufficient cash on hand to cover wages and payroll for a few months, it could consider taking on permanent employees. This could help the company to maintain business operations while the company gets its finances under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "748. Use the loan immediately to offset its short-term expenses, but make payments over a certain period of time in installments.\n",
      "\n",
      "749. Sell assets. The company management usually thinks that the company is on solid ground, so that selling its current assets is not necessary. However, if the company cannot sell all of its assets to generate additional funds, it should seriously analyze the value of the company and its assets to maximize the value of the assets which can be sold and its proceeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "750. Cut production costs. While this might seem too good to be true, this would allow the company to meet its short-term financial goals while at the same time allow the company to save money on the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "751. Redirect the income to finance the line of credit. This could reduce the need to cut marketing expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "752. Cut the cost of services, such as advertising or web development.\n",
      "\n",
      "753. Invest in IT upgrades. For many small companies, this move is impossible. However, as any IT company knows, a small IT upgrade in an IT system is no longer a small upgrade when the system is used by hundreds of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "754. Pay down your debt. You may be in great financial shape, but you cannot cover each debt. For example, if you have a car loan and owe $10000 and you can cover your car, your bank account should be empty before you ask to borrow. The same is true if you owe $10000 of credit cards. You should pay as much of the remaining debts as you can, but avoid overshooting by getting caught in a cycle of debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "755. Consider a corporate buyout. If the company can afford the buyout fee, it can be a good idea to consider a buyout.\n",
      "\n",
      "756. Reduce the number of branches. The company could consider reducing the number of branches and offices, saving more than $3,000,000 each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "757. Retire some people. It is worth looking at ways to replace some of the employees. This would involve the company getting rid of some personnel who are nearing retirement age.\n",
      "\n",
      "758. Layoff employees. The company could consider reducing the workforce temporarily by 20-30%, keeping the core team and main operations personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "759. Sell properties. The company could sell off some of its valuable properties, such as a warehouse, office buildings or industrial equipment.A new report from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that over the past 10 years, students in grades 6-12 have moved away from science and math (STEM) learning to focusing on arts and humanities.\n",
      "\n",
      "760. Improve working capital. Cut interest payments on current accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "761. Invest aggressively in a low cost of capital funds (preferably low cost of capital funds with long term borrowing). This allows cash generation from savings to support the current and expected growth of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "762. Cut salaries and other costs. Management could consider taking a temporary salary cut or salary freeze to help to reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "763. Get a better job. One of the simplest ways to cut costs and save money is to change jobs. For many of you, this is a great idea, but many managers at your company have asked me if I can give you a specific job opportunity to make your way in the company. Let me know if the job is really a good fit for you and, once your application is approved, I'll take action.\n",
      "\n",
      "764. Change the business model. The company could consider selling its current business to a rival company for less than its current market value. The buyer would have to cut down on its operations temporarily, in return taking a lower price per share than what the company paid for in the earlier agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "765. Get rid of non-essential staff. The company could reduce the employee headcount during periods when the business is generating a huge amount of funds, and when it is looking to expand into a new region or market segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "766. Improve customer service. This could take several different forms, one of which is building stronger relationships with potential clients, rather than making phone calls and receiving poor service.\n",
      "\n",
      "767. Take advantage of tax benefits by selling some of its real estate and making cash for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "768. Sell some assets. Selling some assets will provide some immediate benefits but may result in lower earnings in the near term.\n",
      "\n",
      "769. Start selling products or services. The company can sell its own products or services directly to its clients. This reduces the dependency on product sales and service contracts with third party vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "770. Buy equipment for future uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "771. Reduce expenses. This usually requires a bit of judgment, as no company wants to reduce profits too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "772. Purchase assets. Assets are used to generate income and to stay afloat. Since the company is already short or on the verge of short, it is a relatively good idea to buy it. The asset could be an office building, a factory, or an equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "773. Sell assets. Selling the company’s assets could help the company to stay afloat. This is especially applicable for those companies which are highly leveraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "774. Get a higher credit rating. You need to obtain a higher company credit rating in order to be approved on a loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "775. Sell the company. Because of a potential lawsuit from the prior owners or current owners, this is not a good choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "776. Invest in technology. An important consideration is whether it is now possible to replace old software and hardware which has become very burdensome.\n",
      "\n",
      "777. Consider selling some of its assets. If it is a big company with many assets, it may be possible to sell/let others take over its operations, or sell some of its assets to a larger company.\n",
      "\n",
      "778. Cut salaries and bonus programs. This will help the company to avoid a credit down, and make it easier to absorb salary cuts and cost-cutting measures in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "779. Consolidate with competitors. The company could buy a competitor and consolidate operations at a lower operating cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "780. Buy real estate to rent the empty space. This could help the company stay afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "781. Consider raising capital. The most efficient way to cut costs is to raise new capital. This may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "782. Reduce inventory. There are a lot of businesses who keep inventory of products, services and supplies longer than they need. Reducing stock would help cut costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "783. Seek external finance. A company could consider a business loan from an experienced finance firm, particularly if it needs to operate for a longer time period.\n",
      "\n",
      "784. Consider selling assets. A bad economy makes it more difficult to sell company equipment, as well as making the company to focus only on building new products or improving current ones which are profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "785. Reduce wages and benefits. The company could reduce its employee’s wages and salaries by 10-20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "786. Consolidate operations. This is the last and most expensive way to reduce costs. Consolidation could mean selling off part of the company. However, this could help the company retain a core competency and retain its core service offering, and also reduce future costs, as the company can access the funds it needs to keep its doors wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "787. Convert your assets into cash or liquidate them. The first step in going to cash is to sell the company’s assets. Once a company has sold everything it owns, it is possible to put the money in the bank to make a new company in a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "788. Rethink its business model. With many branches and high staff turnover, the company may be in dire need of a central distribution center and logistics unit. Since people would be out of work, the loan could provide the funds needed to improve the logistics model.\n",
      "\n",
      "789. Sell assets and liabilities. At the end of two years of operations, most of the fixed assets the company owns will be sold to an investment company to make way for the sale of the company’s liabilities. The sale of liabilities to an investment company will make the company break-even with the creditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "790. Sell properties to keep afloat. One of the most interesting ways to save will be to sell properties to fund operations. After the sale, the company will be able to reduce the number of active employees by a few percent. While the company can’t go bankrupt, it can survive on less revenue while continuing operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "791. Close down some operations temporarily. Even though the company runs at a high profit margin in the short term, it needs to keep costs low by closing down some operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "792. Sell assets. By selling some of its assets, the company could cut current expenses and get a big profit in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "793. Hire consultants and advisors. The company could invest in new technologies, hire consultants and take a risk on a new business if it is a good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "794. Lay off office workers. This may be an expensive option if the position has low wages, but in the long run it may be cheaper than cutting existing employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "795. Recruit less people and retain more. An obvious way to cut down on costs, but it wouldn’t be as easy as just laying people off. The best way to go is by bringing new people in so that the company can increase its volume and bring in more clients, thereby increasing its profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "796. Find a new source of income. The company’s regular clientele could become an alternative source of income – selling merchandise to a new line of customers, for example, or turning to services which the company used to offer to its regular customer base.\n",
      "\n",
      "797. Take an equity stake. The company could invest its liquid assets, such as accounts receivable and inventories, in a stock exchange listing, or sell them to an early taker. While this will reduce the company’s equity interest and limit liquidity, it is an investment in the long-term and it will protect the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "798. Sell assets. The company might consider selling off certain assets to pay down its liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "799. Retire the older employees. After assessing the liabilities it already has, the company could retire older employees or terminate jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "800. Close down the company and let it float.\n",
      "\n",
      "801. Look for opportunities for future growth. The company could explore outsourcing of some of the tasks such as data entry and admin.\n",
      "\n",
      "802. Take on non-profit organizations. This option would ensure that the company’s charitable missions are sustainable over the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "803. Use discount coupons. The company management can use discount coupons to sell the company’s products to other companies, while cutting down the cost of marketing and advertising the company’s products/services\n",
      "\n",
      "804. Restructure/merge with other firms. Another way the company could look at survival is to close down and merge with other firms. A merger would allow it to benefit from tax benefits and share gains, while a restructuring would help it save some money in the immediate term while the company floats on its core clientele.\n",
      "\n",
      "805. Outsource some of its operations. For example, do the payroll and order collection for the company and let the outsourced company handle the accounts payable function - the company could pay the outsourced company directly based on the payment schedule specified by the company. This step would reduce the company’s liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "806. Invest in other activities. The company should try to invest as much capital as possible, in order to remain relevant in today's competitive market. The company could get some capital from either family or friends, but most likely, it would seek loans from banks if it doesn't have any other assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "807. Sell assets such as equipment, receivables and even store inventory. Such a sale would also help the company pay off its creditors, increase the business’’ flexibility and reduce the overall level of liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "808. Go self-employment. The company could seek outside help by launching an IPO or an affiliate program.\n",
      "\n",
      "809. Sell off assets to generate extra working capital. The company could sell off its valuable assets, in exchange for cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "810. Close the company bank accounts, accounts payable and revenue collections. This would allow the company to continue paying its bills and stay in contact with its clients even if the account has bounced.\n",
      "\n",
      "811. Find another client. If the company sees no viable business elsewhere it can then get out of its current account. All it requires is patience for the company to find another account which suits its needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "812. Reduce employee benefits. Employee benefits may not always have to be paid on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "813. Cut its current contracts with vendors. A company can be forced to do so if the amount of work that has been rendered by a vendor is not to be honored.\n",
      "\n",
      "814. Change its business strategy. The company could reduce its advertising expenditures by 10% and focus its efforts on strengthening relationships with key partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "815. Sell off properties. This would help the company to move out of premises which it may not use on a regular basis (if it were left empty during downturns of the economy) or which might take up very little space in the short run.\n",
      "\n",
      "816. Eliminate unnecessary services and personnel. Removing redundant service personnel and services can save cost significantly – it is estimated a small company spends over 7% annually on employee salaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "817. Cut costs by improving efficiencies. In the short run it will be more economical to buy back underutilized assets instead of disposing items.\n",
      "\n",
      "818. Hire temporary workers. The company is in financial stress, which means it needs to make the most of the money and the resources available in order to stay in business. The company could get hired temporary employees to fill the gap created by lay-offs, and to help it complete the project on time. These workers would also bring in a lot of experience to the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "819. Consider restructuring. With restructuring, the company could cut operating costs. It might be able to cut operating costs by up to 70% while still charging the same quality of customer service and retaining the same level of employee engagement. Restructuring includes selling or merging the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "820. Cut benefits from pension funds and other social safety nets.\n",
      "\n",
      "821. Change your products. If a product doesn't work as well as you thought, switch to a better product.\n",
      "\n",
      "822. Consider voluntary buy outs. A voluntary buy out is a one time expense in which the owners are asked to pay up their severance pay before employees can be laid off permanently. The cost of buy outs is that it delays employees getting severance pay for as long as it takes for a company to lay them off.\n",
      "\n",
      "823. Transfer to overseas subsidiary. If possible, the parent company should transfer operations to an overseas subsidiary where it can remain fully solvent but without any large expenses like a foreign office.\n",
      "\n",
      "824. Eliminate non-core operations. A company with too many non-core operations needs to be eliminated. Also, some of the non-core operations could be outsourced to other private companies for some of their core business.\n",
      "\n",
      "825. Buyout its parent company. The company can purchase the parent company for a fair amount – say 4-6 times the current value.\n",
      "\n",
      "826. Cut salaries or lower wages, with a proviso that the employees remain with the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "827. Invest for the future. After analyzing investment and development plans for the near future, one should invest for the future as far as possible because any company without a strong source of income is likely to cease to exist when that line of credit runs out.The present invention relates to an automatic transmission using an electronic control apparatus which controls a plurality of planetary gear mechanisms to provide a plurality of speed-change stages as well as a hydraulic automatic transmission using the same apparatus.\n",
      "\n",
      "828. Eliminate its liabilities. The company could eliminate any outstanding liabilities as an investment in growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "829. Close a branch. Cloning the branch is very risky and expensive. It will reduce its sales volume and decrease its profits. The branch could be shut down gradually over a period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "830. Get a bigger share of ownership. By buying more shares from a company or individuals in the company, the company would be able to keep costs down, as well as increase its ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "831. Sell the company. If at all possible, the main goal of closing down, is to sell the company so that it can get to the funds it needs to start all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "832. Take out a second mortgage. Another alternative would be to take out a third mortgage from a bank at a rate of, say, 10% of the value of the company.\n",

      "833. Start a new business. The company could be more successful if it began a new business.The effects of in vivo interferon-alpha treatment on the replication of recombinant adenovirus type 2 expressing murine interleukin-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "834. Pay employees in a salary-only mode. If the company does not have any excess capital or it does not need to raise money to fulfill its daily operations, the company could consider paying its employees in cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "835. Layoff people who are not necessary to the main operations. Layoffs will help the company find more efficient ways of running its business.\n",
      "\n",
      "836. Layoff more staff temporarily or take them on indefinite sick leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "837. Cut back on non-essential spending. If you’re spending hundreds of $ on personal expenses, you know your organization is running cash-lows. You need to get back to a business-like pace with fewer expenses in order to maximize your efficiency and profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "838. Reduce capital expenditures. This could mean increasing the capital budget by 10-30%. The company would be able to invest in research and development, new systems or training.\n",
      "\n",
      "839. Start a new business. After all expenses are paid off, the company could start another venture.\n",
      "\n",
      "840. Cut back on unnecessary technology purchases. Once the company is healthy, it should focus on more important areas like marketing, sales, and even HR.\n",
      "\n",
      "841. Cut salaries which are not necessary. For instance, some senior managers and managers, who have been working here for many years, should be considered to be part of the company and make them eligible for severance payment as they are on the verge of retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "842. Eliminate employee stock ownership plans. This strategy would work only for a small period of time while the company gets back on track.\n",
      "\n",
      "843. Don’t take the easy money. The company may take a large lump of cash for working capital and expenses, which would force the management to choose between paying current expenses and paying other liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "844. Pay down debt. Once the company has become more stable, the need to reduce debt becomes urgent to help get credit. This can be done by requesting a temporary extension of the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "845. Sell assets. If the company could sell a few of its assets to reduce its debts, this would be a significant step towards restructuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "846. Sell assets/business licenses. To finance this, it could sell its business licenses with various products that the company produces. This will force the company to cut its expenses, thus reducing its overall expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "847. Reduce the overhead costs of the company to reduce working capital and working relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "848. Get an investment loan. The company can ask for an investment loan which can allow it to buy machinery and buy-out existing investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "849. Sell it at a loss. The company could consider selling its current assets for a small fee to investors who are prepared to put up the funds to buy the company off-the-balance sheet if the need arises. If there is a market for the company, it is a win-win situation. Investors can get a good return on their money (if it is invested in their company) and the company can remain in business for the foreseeable future while investors are assured of a decent return on their original\n",

      "\n",
      "852. Give up debt relief benefits. Many workers take out loans for vacation, mortgage and home and car payments. While these payments might eventually be made, by now the company should realize that this money is better spent on other, more immediately important matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "853. Lay off temporary employees. If it is doing good business, it may choose to lay off a handful of employees every quarter. If it needs to go into bankruptcy, it would not stop such actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "854. Give up on other venture projects. The company had made a good start and the investors want to see the profits growing before they jump in and put the company under debt again. Taking on other business ventures will cost the company plenty of time and money, as well as potentially diluting their chances of being acquired by another company.\n",
      "\n",
      "855. Get rid of bad debtors. This could be done in two ways. First, the company could hire professional lawyers to represent the former partners in court cases against the company. This would bring in a huge amount of cash and would eliminate an unnecessary strain on the company’s credit and its ability to go along with the courts’ demands. The process would take a long time to resolve and at the end the company would not have to pay more than the court asked. The second option would\n",

      "866. Sell a company asset. An asset sale would likely be the most sustainable and low risk, but would require a lot of careful planning and planning skills to pull off. A company could, for example, sell the old company car.\n",
      "\n",
      "867. Reduce operating expenses. It may be advisable to cut operating expenses by 10-20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "868. Move overseas. The company could explore alternatives to its operations, and reduce expenses further by moving some of its operations overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "869. Buy a property. Depending upon the amount of business coming in, the company may consider acquiring additional land and building another facility to rent. Either way, the company would have to hire a professional to take care of such an endeavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "870. Hire temporary replacements. If the main operations team gets cut because of a business emergency, the company can hire temporary engineers to handle the rest of the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "871. Give up some assets. The company could try to divest itself of some assets such as a manufacturing company it already acquired or that might become less profitable in a few years due to inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "872. Change the marketing strategy. When a company's sales are falling, it's time to re-evaluate its marketing strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "873. Review its investments. The company might be thinking of selling its real estate or getting rid of its equipment. By reducing its expenses, the company would be able to make the sales. Also, by reallocating investments, it would improve its profit margins and stay afloat longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "874. Sell its valuable assets. The company could sell its current assets and obtain cash from the proceeds of this sale. Or it could borrow money on the property to get cash, making it more valuable than the current assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "875. Cut staff. With the staff cuts, the management could raise more revenue by increasing the number of new clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "876. Cut marketing expenses:\n",
      "\n",
      "877. Cut expenses. Any expenses in excess of the required amount should be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "878. Consider using a debt relief company. The company could get a debt relief company to come in and assist it in refinancing its debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "879. Use of new equipment. If the company is in a need to enhance its service and efficiency, it can use new or updated equipment and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "880. Increase pension limits. The company should also consider looking at increasing the limits of individual employees’ pension schemes. Doing so will reduce the company’s liabilities and increase its financial position.\n",
      "\n",
      "881. Raise capital from friends, family and investors. With high chances of the company doing well, this is the safest of options.\n",
      "\n",
      "882. Buy a small, cheap facility. If the company’s growth is slow, it could buy a facility where it could run its main operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "883. Use the cash reserve to invest. This means that the company would put the cash reserve into its business. Investing in the business means taking on risk, which is in itself a good thing and which would make a company grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "884. Go out of business. If possible, take a company name and rebrand. This would give back an image and marketability to the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "885. Reorganize the team of operations personnel. When the company has no further need for certain areas of operations, it could consider retraining or the layoff of personnel who are responsible for these areas; this would also help reduce the staff costs related to operational management.\n",
      "\n",
      "886. Increase employee benefits contribution. The employee benefits contribution should increase gradually so as to compensate for the reduction in salaries and/or salaries and benefits in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "887. Sell the company to another company. In many cases, one can sell a company to a competitor for a fraction of a profit. However, when doing so, the company needs to ensure that the selling company has an acceptable business plan and can provide reasonable compensation for the sale price.\n",
      "\n",
      "888. Cut expenses. If the company needs to reduce its expenses without cutting a salary, it can look for ways to reduce the costs of operations and thus reduce the expenses for its monthly salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "889. Reduce employees compensation. If this comes to the rescue, the company could increase compensation for those employed directly by the company, and pay other employees in other businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "890. Reduce the salary of a top executive. This is necessary if the company has to keep existing clients for whom it has become expensive to serve.\n",
      "\n",
      "891. Get rid of sub-contractors. These are costly additions to the company’s payroll and overhead which makes the company look ‘good enough’ to get a contract from any large company considering that the person who is contracted is not capable of meeting the required level of output. The company can then hire extra staff to do the sub-contracting so that the regular workforce is left with the ‘less bad’ work.\n",
      "\n",
      "892. Pay off existing debt. Debtors should be approached for debt consolidation. The company managing it could ask for lower monthly payments, as the remaining debt could be reduced by 75% or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "893. Redeploy surplus resources. Sometimes, a company needs to outsource certain tasks it does not like to undertake or cannot afford to do anymore. This will help the company avoid long-term expenses.Q:\n",
      "\n",
      "894. Restructure debt. The company could restructure its debt, either making it an owned subsidiary or a part of the parent company, or by taking out a new loan to cover uncollectible debt. The latter option is very risky as the whole company could be liable for the outstanding debt at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "895. Consider transferring business to a better-financed counterpart with better credit. Some other company downsizing, for example, of a chain of fast-food restaurants, is not allowed today because of anti-competitive practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "896. Sell off assets. Some companies would consider selling off non-core assets or the company’s valuable intellectual property.\n",
      "\n",
      "897. Increase working capital debtors. Lending on time accounts is usually a great way for a company to improve its financial position.\n",
      "\n",
      "898. Transfer work from abroad. The company may have a choice between having to pay the wages bill in the U.S. or in other countries. If the country isn’t in their main client’s line of business, they may consider outsourcing the work to reduce expenses to retain their existing markets and build their client base with new ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "899. Close offices. Closure of the company’s headquarters or the branch office and lay off employees are the best ways to reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "900. Close out the old debt, or take a more favorable debt restructuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "901. Take on a new venture. Taking on a new business can generate capital, reduce costs, open new possibilities, and help the company to avoid the financial crises which would otherwise ensue from a cut in revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "902. Sell the company. If the core operation of the company can be eliminated without much loss in the short- to medium-terms while the company starts with a clean slate, the company can sell itself to the potential buyer. As a consequence, the buyer would become the controlling partner of the company with a majority shareholding. By selling the key assets, they would realize a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "903. Sell or close its stores. A major company such as Disney, whose core business is amusement parks, has always believed in maintaining its stores, however, the need has changed to the point that the company was forced to close its amusement parks in the US because its parent company decided that the parks were no longer profitable. Similarly, another major company was forced to close a majority of its operations in South Korea due to the Korean economic crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "904. Rethink its business strategy. The new business loan could be a way to get cash flow for future expansion needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "905. Create another product. This is a common technique among small businesses to avoid paying taxes year end. However, some companies use this technique to try and avoid paying capital gains taxes on items.\n",
      "\n",
      "906. Improve cash flow. With a good cash flow, the company could consider taking some of the additional funds to pay back the loan earlier. Once the funding is in place, the company could consider paying itself some of the loans it has taken out in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "907. Sell assets. The company has a lot of assets that could be sold to raise funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "908. Cut salaries. Employee costs could be cut using some part of a severance package.\n",
      "\n",
      "909. Refinancing existing debt. The company may want to refinance debt which represents less than 10% of current liabilities. This would allow the company to stay operational for a longer time while also reducing its annual interest cost and the rate paid on the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "910. Consolidate the company’s business. After determining that the company lacks the financial muscle to hold on to its business, the company management can look for ways to reduce its expenses. The business should decide whether to lay off employees, cut marketing budgets or reduce its current line of credit.Q:\n",
      "\n",
      "911. Reduce the number of office staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "912. Get a new website. A website is something your company management has at its disposal to advertise their products. This will save on costs incurred through advertising. It also helps you to advertise your product and stay up to date on your market.\n",
      "\n",
      "913. Make strategic plans. Sometimes, company management could take initiatives such as consolidating departments, selling businesses or opening new ones. Sometimes one department needs to close down for the good of the company. This might help the company save money but might be an opportunity waiting to be grabbed by the wrong kind of person.\n",
      "\n",
      "914. Reduce non-essential expenses. If the company currently has a long-term clientele, then all marketing expenses the company had in its inception will have to be maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "915. Seek government assistance! The Federal and Provincial governments may grant government assistance if you are in financial distress. For specific details on how to proceed on a case to case basis, refer to “Government Aid and Guarantees for Businesses” from the Ministry of Business, Tourism and Innovation. It has details on how to apply for a business loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "916. Reduce staff or retire. This would take some careful planning as a lot depends on why the company is in financial stress and which part in its lifecycle the company is currently in. A company’s financial plan will decide how to go about this, but you wouldn’t want to risk being in a cash crunch when you are out of growth mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "917. Consider selling assets. A business may consider selling assets to gain cash from the sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "918. Outsource the work. Companies that go this route are likely to achieve an immediate success in terms of revenues. However, such a strategy can also end in failure. The right employees are usually crucial to the success of such projects, but if they are lacking, they are a headache to outsource.\n",
      "\n",
      "919. Buyout its stock. Even if the company would have to invest a significant chunk on buying out its stock, the company could borrow the capital to purchase the stock and keep the investment cost minimized.\n",
      "\n",
      "920. Keep a tight leash on the new management. The new management will get into trouble if they start acting as if they are running the company for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "921. Layoff managers. With the company’s core team still intact, and management able to keep control over the company’s direction, management may consider laying off part of its management team, and reducing the size of the office below the level of 10 employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "922. Sell the company or keep it in house. Depending on various criteria, the company can either exit the business and return to the owner, or it can sell it and retain the original owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "923. Offer a buyout package. An offer to buy the company could be an option to keep the core team afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "924. Invest in marketing. Through new business activities, the company will expand and generate more revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "925. Sell assets. The company is in need of liquidity. Selling off assets will help to reduce liabilities and can help the company to stay afloat a certain time, or at a high rate of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "926. Consider moving to a foreign country. The company could start a foreign operations depending on the country's cost competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "927. Cut the number of employees. It could be done by reducing the number of staff members by 50-80% while keeping the key personnel for key projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "928. Pay cash. In some cases the company could pay for all its debts and start afresh with minimum finance. However, the company would probably have to keep the debtors in place for a while, in case the debtor company might not be able to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "929. Close one or more stores. This will save the company money in the short term if it closes stores for certain time periods in order to consolidate. It could also close stores permanently as its stores are not the main source of income.\n",
      "\n",
      "930. Buy back stock. Stock will lose a lot of value because the company is now flush with cash. After a short-term period, it may be worth more than even cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "931. Change focus to one product or service. In order to maintain its market share over a long period of time, the company might need to focus on one product or service, e.g. car service. In addition to taking a major cut in marketing costs, it also means shifting its management efforts to one single product, while maintaining the core operations and staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "932. Cut expenses. The company could consider cutting its office costs by keeping one or two vacant seats and keeping other employees on salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "933. Seek professional help. If they do not have the expertise to handle things as they are, a company should seriously consider hiring a Business consultant to help manage operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "934. Cut expenses and cut salaries. When a company is struggling to stay afloat, cutting expenses and salaries can help it pay down debt. There are other expenses in the business, such as payroll, office expenses, advertising, etc. That can also be cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "935. Seek a line of credit. The company could seek an out-of-court settlement for the company debts and still keep the core operations unaffected.I am really interested in how the different types of cars are going to be made and how it affects their cost. How does a car like the Bugatti Veyron compete with something like a Ford Focus, or how is the Mustang affected?\n",
      "\n",
      "936. Exit. If the company sells or closes, the management should consider selling everything as a going concern with 100% equity. This way they will take much smaller capital losses during the lifetime of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "937. Sell assets. If the company is not yet profitable, it can sell off its assets which can help save it from bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "938. Cut salaries. Even when the company is in the process of expanding, its employees, especially the key positions in the company, may benefit more by reducing their spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "939. Sell stock. The company owners may consider selling the company's stock after all and this will create good liquidity within the company. The decision would be based upon a decision regarding the company's strategy to achieve growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "940. Consider a special tax deduction or an advance on salary under Section 80C of the Income tax Act, 1961.\n",
      "\n",
      "941. Go private. The management can start with a series of share buy-backs and private equity investments. The cost would be small compared to the company’s debt and other liabilities. This would help the company reduce debt while keeping its core operations operations as it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "942. Turn down new business opportunities. The company management should consider taking in all financial commitments that can be afforded, without adding up with a certain percentage profit per sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "943. Consolidate with similar companies. Having the same core company functions in several businesses will help to keep costs to that particular business constant. In the long run, the business could possibly grow faster if it is joined with a number of other similar companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "944. Use a third-party distributor: In some cases, cutting costs without loss of quality can involve making changes to the existing distribution channel (for instance, the distribution agency). In this case, it is necessary to consult with the agency head to assess the feasibility of the change. It's a good idea to make such consultations at the same time as a reduction of marketing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "945. Reduce debt. As a lender to a company, the Bank would want to know that the company is in good financial shape. After that they will agree to a short-term debt moratorium or a lower interest rate on the existing debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "946. Cut staff. The company managers could lay off 20-30% of their staff, freeing them up to work on other projects in the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "947. Use a credit card. It is also a good idea if the company is able to do such a thing. The cost of credit card, in addition to making the company visible and visible to the credit card issuers, also helps the company to remain viable in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "948. Use employee stock options to maximize benefits. With stock options there is not a limit to the amount that can be earned. In addition, employee stock options can reduce the amount of tax that might be withheld from employee paychecks in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "949. Restructure its operations. This would involve a series of measures to reorganize and streamline its business as well as its financial activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "950. Reduce its fixed expenses. The company may have to reduce its fixed expenses to reduce liabilities; these expenses include, but are not limited to, rent, electricity, salaries, and the cost of providing products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "951. Get new management. If the company cannot be saved by reducing its financial expenses, another company that needs the same services could be acquired. A sale would also give the company its long lost clients and the opportunity to recruit new ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "952. Reduce the workforce. The company could consider cutting 25-30% of its staff and maintaining the rest as they get new jobs. It could continue to use the rest for maintaining the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "953. Buy a company in a better economic climate. Often, the best time to buy the company is when you’d otherwise lose money. However, due to the fluctuation of the economy, one should always do due diligence before making such a big decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "954. Sell off its inventory. Sometimes inventory is a problem that a company wants to get rid off. So, let the company sell its products to customers who can pay for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "955. Change management. After the company’s cash flow problems, changes in management need to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "956. Cut back on services. If the company’s current sales and profit is not sufficient, perhaps the company could look for a better supplier.\n",
      "\n",
      "957. Find another employer. When a company gets into serious financial trouble, there is an excellent chance that another company would hire it to fill a critical gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "958. Buy low and sell high. This is a tough choice for a company that needs to cut costs, but if the company’s current sales are down 20% or 30%, you may want to buy inventory that is still selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "959. Sell out and restructure. This could require a huge write-off of the outstanding equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "960. Consolidate departments. This might make a bit of a shock to the organization, but many companies do this to reduce costs in various ways. For instance, one company which had a number of departments like the HR function, IT and accounting combined, decided to merge the HR function to one which had its own structure and benefits. The company had always wanted to buy more computers to save money, but also wanted to retain its people, so it did the same merger. It saved $1m during the\n",
      "\n",
      "961. Delay payroll. The company could delay payroll as long as it takes to pay off the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "962. Start selling other assets. After assessing the current assets this could be one of the best moves for the company. However, this is not an advisable option if one of its main assets like a manufacturing facility is vital for the survival of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "963. Sell or lease equipment. If there is no longer interest in acquiring new equipment, this would help the company secure more affordable equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "964. Re-negotiate the contract with the vendor. A renegotiation which may increase the vendor's margins can save the company money and bring new revenues into the enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "965. Look for new clients. As mentioned previously, cutting marketing costs will reduce inflow of new clients, but will save money in the short term while the business continues a slow drift to oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "966. Stop doing certain activities which are not productive. The company management should stop spending excessive money in marketing, advertising, research & development, distribution etc. and concentrate on its core activities. For example, stopping advertising campaigns at the same time, eliminating promotion for certain products, dropping certain products/services from the company’s clientele. All these decisions would help the company manage its expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "967. Eliminate inventory. The company could cut inventory significantly to keep in-house processing of orders, while it is also possible to sell the inventory and generate additional revenue for the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "968. Sell assets. The company could consider an asset sale to make it free at that point; this would be a time-consuming process, as the assets would need to be physically inspected and appraised by a professional. However, if the company could find an eager buyer who was not too concerned with the future of the company, they could probably save themselves a lot of trouble and expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "969. Increase cash flow through cash management. The company could improve cash flow by increasing its cash reserves and making better use of its assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "970. Stop investing in new business ventures. The company could cease new investments within the company and instead invest in new markets with lower risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "971. Cut the executive travel budget by 50%. This will help the overall morale and morale of the employees, thus creating more productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "972. Reduce working hours. The reduced working hours will help the company save money without losing quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "973. Cut costs with technology. Using technology would increase the production by 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "974. Buy a new product/service. This can be a risky move as the company could potentially be overwhelmed by a new product that could revolutionize its business.\n",
      "\n",
      "975. Stop selling products. It is normal to sell products to get cash flow going so that the company can survive for a definite period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "976. Use part of the company's working capital to buy stock in a company which would offer a better rate of return.\n",
      "\n",
      "977. Pay employees lower wages. If the company is cash-flow positive, cutting wages can significantly reduce overhead costs by cutting non-compensated employees and employees’ cost of doing business.\n",
      "\n",
      "978. Redirect investment. When an increase in earnings is foreseen, some of it could then be directed to the expenses needed to run the company, keeping the core team and operations intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "979. Make the company cash flow positive. The management knows the company is suffering a severe cash crunch. The company could ask the bank to provide the necessary capital to the company to stay afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "980. Consider selling its assets. If the company were to completely shut down, then selling its assets would allow it to be taken over by its current creditors and would allow it to stay afloat for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "981. Sell the company. The company can list the company in a public offering, or a private sale, and take advantage of this as a way out. If the company does not work out, then it can be sold with all rights to the employees/shareholders or simply liquidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "982. Eliminate products it doesn’t produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "983. Cut salaries by 25-50%. Employees could work during their vacation time. In addition, they could take some of their vacation days or days off during the year to get more rest when they’re not employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "984. Sell off products or services. Having a core team of people dedicated to just doing the work of the company may cut short its future growth. The company could even consider doing this over a number of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "985. Reorganize the business. The company could reorganize itself through the acquisition of another business.\n",
      "\n",
      "986. Refund current clients. The company could refund current clients who were either misinformed or misdirected by the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "987. Use tax-free cash. The company could take cash advances and/or loan from tax-free savings or personal accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "988. Lay off employees. The company could start the lay-off process of employees who are on salary. Employees who have been contributing money towards the company would likely bear the brunt of lay-off with unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "989. Close its unprofitable products. The company could choose to limit its offerings in its current market to products that deliver quality and value.\n",
      "\n",
      "990. Start up a new subsidiary.\n",
      "\n",
      "991. Cut staff or subcontractors. The company should either reduce the workforce by 20-30%, or lay off employees temporarily. Cutting the workforce will save money and time in the near term, but the company needs to ensure that the new employees are properly trained and qualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "992. Buy an asset(s). The company has a lot of assets (a few thousand computers for starters) which it hasn´t been using for a long time, and may be time to find the good uses for the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "993. Cut management in-house. The company should find someone else to manage the day-to-day operations, so as to eliminate the possibility of the company being completely run down.\n",
      "\n",
